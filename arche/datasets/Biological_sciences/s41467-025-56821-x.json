    "content": "The pituitary is the most critical endocrine gland in humans, regulating key physiological functions by hormone secretion. Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs, also known as pituitary adenomas) are among the most prevalent intracranial tumors originating from the anterior pituitary gland (APG) [1] . The pathological classification of PitNETs incorporates the expression of specific hormone genes and three lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs), including PIT1 ( POU1F1 ), TPIT ( TBX19 ), and SF1 ( NR5A1 ) [2] . While the tumors within the same lineage have identical TF expressions, they exhibit variations in cellular functions and tumorigenesis. The PIT1 lineage commonly exhibits excessive hormone secretion, including somatotroph tumors (secreting growth hormone, GH), lactotrophs tumors (secreting prolactin, PRL) and thyrotroph tumors (secreting thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSH). Mixed somatotroph-lactotroph tumors secret GH and PRL (PG) and plurihormonal PIT1 lineage tumors secret all three hormones (PIT1M). The TPIT lineage tumors contain only one type, namely corticotroph tumors (secreting adrenocorticotrophic hormone, ACTH) and SF1 lineage contain gonadotroph tumors (GO, secreting follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH, and luteinizing hormone, LH) [3] . Null cell tumors (NULL) lack hormone production or specific TF expression, whereas plurihormonal tumors express multiple hormones with two or more lineages [2] . But even the same subtypes also exhibit diverse clinical manifestations. For instance, functional corticotroph tumors demonstrate typical Cushing symptoms because of ACTH oversecreting, while silent corticotroph tumors (with ACTH expressing but without Cushing symptoms) demonstrate more aggressive clinical behavior compared to other subtypes [4] . The complex hormone secretion profiles and highly variable clinical outcomes of these tumors present both requirements and challenges for more precise subtype classification. However, to date, the pathogenesis of most subtypes remains poorly understood and genomic markers for characterization are still lacking. Previous studies have predominantly focused on exploring genetic features or overall gene expression for additional molecular features of PitNETs [1] , overlooking co-transcriptional regulations. Alternative splicing (AS) is an essential cellular process in eukaryotes that generates multiple transcripts, diversifying final protein products [5] . Beyond PitNETs, AS has been extensively studied in various human tumors [6] , offering invaluable resources for a better understanding of inter-tumor heterogeneity and developing new therapies [7] . However, the overall landscape of splicing changes in PitNETs has not been thoroughly investigated so far. Here, we characterize the alternative splicing landscape of PitNETs using the PitNETs cohort with transcriptome sequencing, including bulk ( n = 268 patients) and full-length single-cell RNA-seq ( n = 195,720 cells) datasets from tumor tissues. Our analysis spans almost all PitNET subtypes, allowing us to construct subtype-specific splicing patterns and corresponding regulatory networks of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). In contrast to the expression of TFs, our analysis more faithfully captures the transcriptomic diversity of PitNETs, thereby better demonstrating inter-tumor heterogeneity. Notably, within the TPIT lineage, we identify a distinct splicing regulatory pattern with significant clinical relevance. These findings are robustly validated by an independent cohort of 180 pituitary tumors. Overall, our study offers an enhanced approach to PitNET classification.",
