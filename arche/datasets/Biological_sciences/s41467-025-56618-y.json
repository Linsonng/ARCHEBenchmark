    "content": "Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data captures the spatial organisation and heterogeneity of genes in tissues at high resolution, fundamentally transforming the way we study and understand biological processes. It has enabled the identification of key genes and pathways involved in intricate mechanisms underlying diverse biological processes and complex cellular phenomena [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] . While these new SRT technologies hold promise for producing new insights, they remain costly, preventing their direct adoption into routine clinical use at this stage. In contrast, haematoxylin-and-eosin-stained (H&E) histopathology images are more cost-effective and are routinely used in clinical practice. Thus, if we can leverage modern machine learning together with information from SRT technologies to predict in silico spatial profiles of gene expression values from paired histology images of the same tissue, we could enhance information gained from existing H&E images. This would facilitate large-scale examinations of spatial gene expression variations and lead to the potential discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for complex diseases. To date, several approaches have been developed to predict in silico spatially resolved gene expression (SGE) patterns using H&E data alone (Fig. 1a , Supplementary Table 1 ). Among these methods, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformers are commonly selected architectures for extracting local and global 2D vision features around each sequenced spot from corresponding histology image patches. Some methods further implemented extra components, including super-resolution enhancement of SGE and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to capture neighbourhood relationships between adjacent spots. Furthermore, an exemplar module had been used to guide predictions by inferring from the gene expression (GE) of the most similar exemplars. These learned features are then used to predict SGE that enables image-based screening for molecular biomarkers with spatial variation. As these methods were recently published in the last 3 years and are continuously evolving, their performance has not yet been comprehensively benchmarked. While there exist general reviews on various aspects of SRT analysis [5] , [6] , [7] , they have only surveyed and categorised methods predicting SGE from H&E without any benchmarking. Fig. 1: Overview of the benchmarking process and the key aspects of the evaluation. a Illustration of the machine learning task of predicting spatial gene expression from H&E images. b Overview of the evaluation categories used in the benchmarking of each method.

Full size image Evaluation studies that are presented when proposing a new method are limited in nature and often not independent. Among the current literature, methods for predicting SGE from H&E have been mainly assessed and evaluated for their efficacy by their developers. Evidently, different evaluation frameworks have been used to assess the methods. For instance, ST-Net [8] , DeepSpaCE [9] , DeepPT [10] and TCGN [11] evaluated the performance of their models on external The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [12] data to determine the generalisability of their models. Hist2ST [13] , EGNv1 [14] , EGNv2 [15] , TCGN and THItoGene [16] performed an ablation study to assess the contributions of different components of their deep-learning architecture. BrST-Net [17] conducted a comparison of 10 state-of-the-art CNN and transformer architectures to determine the effectiveness of the backbone models. iStar [18] demonstrated the application of its predictions by performing tissue region segmentation. Overall, there is no consistent and detailed evaluation framework comparing the performance of these approaches in predicting in silico SGE, due in part to the recent development of this field, limited data availability and the complexity of executing these methods. Consequently, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the performance, stability and the broader applicability of individual methods. Additionally, there is a lack of critical evaluation regarding how different spatial characteristics of H&E images can affect the accuracy of SGE predictions, especially on their impact on downstream analysis as well as potential clinical translation. To this end, we provide a benchmark and review of methods predicting SGE from H&E images. We compared the performance of eleven methods using 28 different metrics broadly grouped into five categories. These include metrics that focus on the evaluation of spatial and biological characteristics of genes that are predicted effectively. Metrics also include the impact of prediction performance on downstream applications. Given the ongoing development in predicting SGE from H&E providing exciting potential for clinical usage, our benchmark study provides an analysis of significant achievements of existing methods, demonstrating their practical impact. Importantly, we provide a vital assessment of the limitations and generalisability of their translational potential. Ultimately, we offer guidance for new users of these methods and highlight current challenges for developers aiming to advance methodologies. Furthermore, our study can serve as a valuable tool, facilitating the rapid and independent evaluation of future methods.",
