    "content": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in the cell cytoplasm of nematodes, plants and animals [1] , [2] , [3] . Mature miRNAs can also be detected extracellularly in bodily fluids including serum, saliva, breast milk, cerebrospinal fluid, seminal fluid, urine, and faeces [4] , [5] . Here, encapsulation within the phospholipid membranes of extracellular vesicles (EVs) enhances their extracellular stability [6] . These EVs are decorated with proteins and lipids that facilitate their function as communication molecules and enable the transport of diverse cargo including miRNAs between different tissues [7] . In the mammalian intestine, miRNAs perform essential roles in barrier integrity, metabolism, regulation of the mucosal immune response and in microbial homoeostasis [5] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] . The miRNAs produced by intestinal epithelial cells are detectable in EVs in faeces, and offer a promising non-invasive tool to study intestinal disease [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] . Previous work has employed microarrays and qPCRs to study faecal miRNAs, primarily in the contexts of colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [18] , [19] , [20] . In gastrointestinal cancers and IBD, alterations in specific miRNAs have been identified as novel diagnostic tools and indicators of disease severity and prognosis [18] , [21] , [22] . However, substantial heterogeneity in study design, including variations in sample storage, miRNA isolation, and data analysis, limits the reproducibility and utility of these findings [18] . More recently, faecal miRNA profiles in humans and mice were examined using high-throughput small RNA sequencing [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [23] , [24] . However, there remains a limited understanding of the reproducibility of miRNA profiles in faecal samples across studies, or if faecal miRNA profiles are stable in health and homoeostasis. We addressed these limitations by developing an optimised faecal small RNA sequencing pipeline and performing a meta-analysis of recently published small RNA sequencing data from murine faecal samples. As a result, we establish best practices for this technique and identify a core faecal miRNA profile that is consistent across laboratory practices. Furthermore, our current study reports the first longitudinal analysis of murine faecal miRNAs in healthy mice. We then demonstrate the utility of our pipeline in hypothesis generation by analysing changes in faecal miRNAs due to chronic Trichuris muris (mouse whipworm) infection. T. muris is a model of the human gastrointestinal whipworm, Trichuris trichiura , which is estimated to infect over 500 million individuals globally and causes chronic diarrheal disease predominantly in children [25] , [26] . During pathogenesis, T. muris disrupts the intestinal epithelium, perturbs the microbiota, and induces a Th1 or Th2-polarised mucosal immune response, each of which are processes that are regulated by miRNAs in the intestine [5] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [27] , [28] . In T. muris infection, the generation of a Th1-type immune response is associated with chronicity and the inability to clear the infection [28] . Conversely, mice that are resistant to infection generate a Th2-polarised response that facilitates wound healing, tissue remodelling and expulsion [28] . Here, we demonstrate that chronic infection induces the differential expression of miRNAs associated with wound healing, barrier integrity, and fibrosis. These findings suggest that miRNAs may be a route by which tissue damage is repaired in a Th1-polarised chronic infection, despite the absence of the typical tissue remodelling anti-helminth Th2 cytokines.",
