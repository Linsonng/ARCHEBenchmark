    "content": "Psychedelics include classic serotonergic psychedelics, such as psilocybin and 5-methoxy- N,N -dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), and related psychoactive compounds, such as ketamine and 3,4-methyl enedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA). These compounds have recently gained widespread interest as potential therapeutics for neuropsychiatric disorders [1] , [2] . Psilocybin with psychological support is under active investigation as a treatment for major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] . Subanesthetic ketamine has long been studied for its efficacy in treating depression [8] , [9] , [10] and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [11] . The research efforts culminated in the approval of esketamine nasal spray by the FDA in the United States for treatment-resistant depression [12] , [13] . Finally, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has undergone phase III clinical trials for the treatment of moderate to severe PSTD [14] , [15] . The clinical relevance has sparked intense interest in understanding the shared and distinct aspects of these compounds’ mechanisms of action. Beyond the known psychedelics, there is also growing excitement for synthesizing novel psychedelic-inspired analogs that can be new chemical entities for therapeutics [16] , [17] , [18] . Ideally, the novel compounds would retain therapeutic effects while improving pharmacokinetics, minimizing perceptual effects, and eliminating cardiovascular risks. A major roadblock in this pursuit lies in developing screens that can filter thousands of psychedelic-inspired analogs to a manageable list of the most promising compounds for further in-depth characterizations. Currently, most screens operate at the molecular or behavioral level. At the molecular level, candidate compounds can be docked in silico with the structure of the 5-HT 2A receptor, followed by biochemical measurements of receptor engagement and activation of downstream G-protein and beta-arrestin pathways. This target-based approach has yielded exciting leads [19] , [20] , [21] , [22] , but assumes that the 5-HT 2A receptor is the key mediator of the therapeutic effect, which has not been proven conclusively. At the behavioral level, candidate compounds may be tested in animals for defined phenotypes. Simple characterizations such as changes in animal movement patterns may be automated to increase throughput and accuracy [23] , [24] . However, more complex behavioral assays relevant for depression suffer from limitations, including poor construct validity and weak predictive power for drug efficacy in humans [25] . The development of a new screening method may complement current molecular and behavioral approaches to accelerate preclinical drug discovery. Classic psychedelics and ketamine share the ability to enhance neural plasticity in the brain [26] , as evidenced by the rapid and persistent growth of dendritic spines in the rodent medial frontal cortex after a single dose of ketamine [27] , [28] , psilocybin [29] , and related serotonergic receptor agonists [30] , [31] , [32] , [33] . A promising approach may thus focus on quantifying indicators of neural plasticity in native brain tissues. To this end, immediate early genes are activated in a cell in response to increased firing activity or an external stimulus [34] . The immediate early genes are a key part of neural plasticity, because they enable neurons to adapt to stimuli by regulating gene expression, which is crucial for protein synthesis that is needed for synaptic modifications and learning [35] , [36] . Taking classic psychedelics as an example, drug administration induces robust increases in the expression of immediate early genes [37] , [38] , including c-Fos, that can be detected starting in as few as 30 minutes in multiple brain regions [39] , [40] . More recently, technological advances in tissue clearing, light sheet fluorescence microscopy, and automated detection of nuclei have enabled high-throughput mapping of the expression of immediate early genes such as c-Fos in the whole mouse brain [41] , [42] . We and others have applied this method to characterize the impact of psilocybin and ketamine [43] , [44] , [45] , joining a rapidly growing number of studies using brain-wide imaging of fluorescence signals to study drugs [46] , [47] , [48] , [49] , [50] , [51] , [52] , [53] , [54] , [55] , [56] , [57] . Although these early studies have provided valuable biological insights, only one or two drugs were typically included in each study thus far. Developing the method as a drug screen requires evaluating its feasibility and accuracy on a larger panel of compounds. In this study, we measured brain-wide c-Fos expression in male and female mice for 8 drug conditions, including a variety of psychedelics, related psychoactive compounds, and vehicle control. We developed a pipeline for analysis and classification based on explainable machine learning, determining performance in one-versus-rest and one-versus-one classification tasks. We implemented Shapley additive explanation to interpret the machine learning models to identify the brain regions driving the classifications. Collectively the results demonstrate brain-wide imaging of immediate early gene expression as a promising approach for preclinical drug discovery.",
