    "content": "In the past several years, there has been an explosion in the discovery of bacterial phage defense systems [1] . Not lagging far behind have been the discoveries of counter-defense mechanisms by which phages block these bacterial immune mechanisms [2] . Most phage counter-defense mechanisms described to date are non-enzymatic in nature. Such direct, but non-enzymatic defenses consist of phage counter-defense elements that function by directly blocking the bacterial defense system via binding of the defense effector protein [3] , [4] , titrating an intermediate signaling molecule [5] , [6] , or structurally mimicking the defense target [7] , [8] , [9] . These proteins rarely have homologs outside of phage genomes and are typically highly specific for the defense system that they inhibit. In contrast, relatively fewer enzymatic counter-defense proteins have been identified [2] . Examples of enzymatic counter-defense elements include proteins that either degrade small molecule alarmone signals or produce competing decoy small molecules [10] , [11] , [12] , covalently modify a protein target [13] , [14] , or replenish a molecule degraded by the defense system [15] . Whether enzymatic counter-defenses are less common, or just more challenging to characterize, is not yet clear. One family of toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, the DarTG systems, were recently shown to provide robust phage defense [16] . TA systems are two-gene operons that encode a toxin, which typically inhibits growth of the bacterial cell, and a cognate, neutralizing antitoxin that prevents toxin activity under homeostatic conditions [17] . DarT1 and DarT2 are DNA ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins that modify single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), targeting guanosine and thymidine, respectively [18] , [19] , [20] . ADP-ribosylated DNA cannot be replicated, and in some cases also cannot be transcribed, thereby preventing phage replication [16] . Two different types of DarTG systems have been identified: DarTG1 systems, in which the antitoxin, DarG1, is a protein of the NADAR (NAD and ADP-ribose) superfamily [18] , and DarTG2 systems, in which the antitoxin DarG2 contains a macrodomain, another type of ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase domain that has been extensively characterized as an ADP-ribose eraser in eukaryotic cells [19] . The antitoxins display specificity, with each antitoxin only able to remove ADPr from the base modified by its cognate toxin. In addition to its ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase macrodomain, DarG2 proteins have a second, DarT2-interacting domain which contributes to their ability to neutralize the toxin [21] , [22] . The NADAR domain of DarG1 contains an N-terminal extension of unknown function, but has not been shown to interact with its cognate toxin [18] . The two systems defend against different sets of diverse phages with only some overlap in the targets [16] . To date, three phage counter-defense strategies have been discovered for phage evasion of DarTG-mediated defense [16] , [23] . The SECϕ18 phage, normally susceptible to DarTG2 defense, was shown to acquire resistance by accumulating mutations in its DNA polymerase that enable phage replication of ADP-ribosylated DNA. The other two known anti-DarTG counter-defenses, termed AdfA and AdfB, were identified in E. coli phage RB69 and Vibrio cholera phage ICP1, respectively, via escape mutant analyzes. Escape mutants in both cases had acquired a single nucleotide polymorphism that appeared to enable an existing counter-defense element to neutralize the DarT toxin [23] . Both AdfA and AdfB are small proteins with no homology to known proteins families that seem to block DarT activity through an interaction with the toxin. In both cases, the DarT-neutralizing variants of the genes were found to naturally exist within related phages, suggesting that the inactive variant may have evolved to neutralize another DarT homolog. We previously found that while the T4 phage encodes an active DarT1-blocking AdfA allele, a T4 ∆ adfA phage remains resistant to DarTG1, even though this protein restores RB69 infectivity of DarTG1 cells when ectopically expressed [16] . These data suggest the presence of a second, unknown anti-DarTG1 factor in T4 phage. Here, we investigate the molecular basis for the resistance of T4 and most of its relatives of the Tevenvirinae subfamily to the DarTG1 phage defense system. Using an expanded set of Tevenvirinae from the BASEL phage collection [24] , we find that neither the presence of AdfA in the genomes of these phages, nor its allele type (active or inactive), correlate with DarTG1 susceptibility. Instead, all Tevenvirinae – with the exception of RB69 – are resistant to DarTG1 defense. By co-infecting with a sensitive and resistant phage and characterizing the resulting chimeric viruses that have acquired DarTG1 resistance, we identified a second anti-DarTG1 counter defense element that is conserved within the T-even subfamily of phages. This element, which we have termed a nti- D arT f actor N ADAR (AdfN), is both necessary and sufficient for phage counter-defense. AdfN T4 is a member of the NADAR super family, which also includes the DarG1 antitoxin, and we show that like DarG1, AdfN T4 has enzymatic activity that allows it to remove ADP-ribose from DNA. We further find that other phage NADARs have similar enzymatic activity. Phylogenetic analyzes indicate that phages have likely independently co-opted NADAR domain proteins multiple times from different bacterial or archaeal sources, and that these NADAR proteins function as orphan antitoxins to reverse the activity of a TA-associated DarT1 toxin.",
