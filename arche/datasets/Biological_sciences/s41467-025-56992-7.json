    "content": "Rice ( Oryza sativa L.) is a major food crop with tropical origins and is sensitive to low temperatures. Temperate rice of the japonica subspecies is grown in a wider geographic range than indica and tropical japonica rice and can be grown in colder regions at higher altitudes and latitudes. In contrast, indica and tropical japonica rice are better suited for cultivation in regions with more abundant light and higher temperatures [1] , [2] . Considering the increased frequency of extreme weather events on a global scale, low-temperature stress is becoming a serious threat to rice production. In China, an estimated 3–5 million tons of rice production is lost annually due to low temperatures in the autumn [3] . From 1999 to 2012, rice production in China decreased by about 3.7% due to extreme cold [4] . Cold injury at the booting stage leads to spikelet sterility, a lower seed setting, and consequently a direct decrease in yield, resulting in irreparable losses [5] , [6] . Therefore, identifying new genes that confer cold tolerance at the booting stage would be beneficial for rice production. Cold tolerance is a complex trait controlled by multiple genes in rice, with different genes playing roles at various developmental stages. At the early stage of germination, favorable alleles of genes such as qLTG3-1 , OsLTPL159 and OsUBC12 promote rice germination and growth under low-temperature [7] , [8] , [9] . For instance, OsUBC12 encodes an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, increase low temperature germinability in japonica rice by inhibiting ABA signaling [9] . At the seedling stage, genes such as LTG1 , COLD1 , qCTS9 , bZIP73 , HAN1 , COLD11 , COG1 , COG2 and COG3 have been identified through linkage analysis or association studies [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] . For example, COLD1 encodes a G-protein signaling regulator that interacts with the G-protein α subunit RGA1 to perceive cold signals, activating Ca 2+ channels to initiate cold-specific signaling [10] . COG1 encodes a receptor-like protein that, together with its co-receptor kinase OsSERL2, senses low temperatures and activates downstream defense responses through the MAPK cascade [11] . Other genes like LTG1 , qCTS9 , HAN1 and bZIP73 modulate cold tolerance through pathways involving auxin, brassinosteroid (BR) signaling, jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] . COLD11 , COG2 and COG3 are involved in rice responses to cold stress through distinct pathways, including DNA repair, cell wall remodeling and maintenance of photosynthesis, respectively [16] , [17] , [18] . Although the studies on cold tolerance at the early stages have provided valuable insights, understanding the molecular mechanisms of cold tolerance at the booting stage is crucial due to its direct impact on grain yield. However, fewer genes for cold tolerance at the booting stage have been identified. bZIP73 involves in the bZIP73 Jap –qLTG3-1 Nip –sugar transport pathway, which promotes sugar transport to pollen at low temperatures [19] . CTB4a encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase that interacts with AtpB to increase energy supply, thereby improving the seed setting in rice grown at high altitudes [20] . CTB2 encodes a UDP-glucose sterol glucosyltransferase that mediates the accumulation of steryl glycoside and acyl steryl glycoside to maintain cell membrane permeability and reduce damage to pollen grains and pollen walls under cold stress conditions [21] . Other genes, such as Ctb1 (an F-box protein) [22] , qCTB7 (a PHD-finger domain protein) [23] and OsLEA9 (a late embryogenesis abundant protein) [24] , have been implicated in cold tolerance, although their precise molecular roles remain to be clarified. The calmodulin-binding transcriptional activator (CAMTA) family of transcription factors plays important roles in plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses. In Arabidopsis , AtSR1 (AtCAMTA3), AtCAMTA1 and AtCAMTA2 negatively regulate the biosynthesis of salicylic acid and N -hydroxypipecolic acid by suppressing the expression of AtSARD1 and AtCBP60g , which in turn suppresses plant immunity [25] . AtSR1, AtCAMTA1 and AtCAMTA2 along with AtCAMTA5 positively regulate freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis and can respond to low temperatures and activate the expression of AtDREB1 ( CBF ) genes and other cold-inducible genes [26] . AtSR1 activates several RNA interference (RNAi)-related genes for defense against viral invasion [27] . AtSR1 also functions as a transcriptional activator in drought stress and positively regulates drought tolerance [28] . Furthermore, CAMTA6 negatively regulate salt tolerance [29] . In rice, the CAMTA transcription factor OsCBT1 and OsCAMTA3 also negatively regulates plant immune responses to pathogens [30] , [31] , whereas the rice CAMTAs SCT1 and SCT2 synergistically repress wax synthesis regulatory 2 ( OsWR2 ) expression and negatively regulate heat tolerance [32] . However, whether CAMTA family transcription factors play a role in rice cold acclimatization remains unknown. In this work, we identify the CTB3 gene, which encodes a calmodulin-binding transcription factor controlling cold tolerance at the booting stage. The allele of CTB3 with the 57-bp and 284-bp deletions is derived from Chinese wild rice ( O. rufipogon ) and promotes the cold adaptation of japonica rice. OsTCP19 suppresses CTB3 expression by binding to the two indel regions and thereby negatively regulates cold tolerance at the booting stage. Furthermore, CTB3 activates the expression of OsTPP1 , leading to reduced Tre6P content. The lower Tre6P content promotes the expression of sugar-transporter-related genes, which increase the accumulation of sugar in the panicles, thereby enhancing cold tolerance. Our results show that the two favorable alleles of OsTCP19 and CTB3 have been selected and retained in japonica rice to improve cold tolerance and promote the expansion of rice to high-latitude regions. These findings highlight the role of CTB3 in promoting cold adaptation and offer a potential target for improving cold tolerance in rice breeding.",
