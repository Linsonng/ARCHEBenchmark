    "content": "In recent decades, drug-resistant pathogens have emerged as major global health challenge [1] . These bacteria are notorious for their ability to evade commonly used antibiotics through various multi-drug resistance mechanisms [2] , [3] . The six most frequently occurring pathogens associated with drug-resistant infections include Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Acinetobacter baumannii , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , which were linked to an estimated 3.57 million deaths related to antibiotic resistance in 2019 [4] , [5] . The acronym ESKAPEE (often simplified to ESKAPE) is commonly used to refer to a closely related group of highly virulent and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens that includes all the above, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae , and adds Enterobacter spp. and Enterococcus faecium . Given the scale of this threat, new approaches to develop effective antibiotics against these pathogens are urgently needed [3] , [6] . In this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are increasingly being explored as promising candidates to combat ESKAPE pathogens [7] . Naturally occurring AMPs are integral components of the innate immune system of many species, including humans, where they play a crucial role in preventing infections [8] . To harness this potential, researchers have developed both natural and synthetic AMPs valued for their fast and efficient bactericidal actvity [7] , [9] . AMPs are typically short, cationic, amphipathic peptides with variable sequences and structures [8] . Initially, they were regarded as a uniform group of molecules that exert their antimicrobial effects primarily by disrupting bacterial membranes through mechanisms such as pore formation, insertion into the lipid bilayer, disruption of the membrane lipid backbone, or transmembrane channel formation [8] . However, it is now recognized that the mechanism of action of AMPs is more diverse and can also involve interaction with intracellular targets, enhancing their potential as candidate therapeutics against drug-resistant microbes [10] . Interestingly, a subclass of AMPs has been shown to undergo amyloid formation, although the importance of their antimicrobial activity remains unclear [11] . We recently designed antimicrobial peptides with a novel mechanism of action that induces aggregation of a target protein, thereby causing loss of function [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] . The mode of action of these peptides is based on aggregation-prone regions (APRs) within their polypeptide sequence, which can drive the misfolding and aggregation of proteins containing homologous APRs [17] . Most proteins have at least one APR in their sequence [18] and targeting can be highly specific. APRs are typically located in the hydrophobic core of globular proteins or in transmembrane (TM) regions of TM proteins [18] , which are sites where mutation rates are intrinsically low. For instance, peptides designed to target beta-lactamases exhibit a knock-out phenotype, meaning they show conditional toxicity in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics [12] . These peptides can even differentiate between related classes of beta-lactamases whose APRs differ by a few amino acids. An alternative design principle for antibacterial aggregating peptides is to find APRs that occur in multiple proteins within the bacterial proteome [14] , thereby targeting a broader range of proteins simultaneously. This strategy aims to reduce the impact of single resistance-conferring mutations [19] and cause widespread aggregation, leading to proteostatic collapse. Given the known value of bacterial membrane homeostasis as a target for broad spectrum antibiotics, we explored whether disruption of membrane protein folding could yield broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against ESKAPE pathogens. For this purpose, we turned to a peptide called P33 that we previously identified in a screen against E. coli using randomly selected APRs of E. coli proteins [14] . The screen was designed to select APRs that have a maximal number of homologous fragments occurring in different proteins across the E. coli proteome, with the goal of inducing the aggregation of multiple proteins at once and causing a failure of protein homeostasis [14] . P33 emerged as a potent hit and is based on an APR from the transmembrane region of E. coli threonine/homoserine exporter RhtA (UniProt identifier RHTA_ECOLI, Fig. 1A ). The peptide follows our typical design pattern, consisting of a tandem repeat of an APR of RhtA ( 97 LGIAVAL 103 ,), flanked by arginine residues and separated by a linker (to yield R-LGIAVAL-RR-P-R-LGIAVAL-RR, Fig. 1A ). The arginine residues are known to be critical for bacterial cell uptake and hence the overall antibiotic effect [19] . This profile of hydrophobic peptides with a positive charge is also seen in ‘classical’ AMPs that act directly on the membrane [8] . In a subsequent study on resistance development in E. coli , we observed a lack of resistance build-up against this peptide, including in the hypermutating E. coli strain XL-1 Red [19] , consistent with a mode of action involving multiple targets. Fig. 1: The mechanism of action of P33 is dependent on protein aggregation. A Structural views of the RhtA protein image generated with Yasara. The peptide P33 is derived from an APR sequence of the E. coli threonine/homoserine exporter RhtA (left). The peptide is designed according to the standard pattern, which consists of an APR of RhtA (L 97 GIAVAL 103 ) repeated in tandem, flanked by arginine residues and separated by a linker (right). Super resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) of E. coli ATCC 25922 cells stained with pFTAA upon treatment with (B) the beta-lactam antibiotic Ampicillin, ( C) the classic membrane disrupting polymyxin antibiotic colistin, or (D , E) P33. Images show a single representative micrograph of one out of three independent repeats performed. F Atomic force microscopy-based infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) image of E. coli ATC 15922 treated with P33, highlighting inclusion body (blue), cytoplasm (orange) and epoxy (green) spectra indicated. The experiment was independently repeated three times with similar results. G Normalized AFM-IR spectra from locations indicated in (F). The inclusion body spectra exhibit a shoulder at 1630 cm-1, indicative of amyloid formation. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) image of E.coli cells treated with (H) the vehicle control (I) P33 or (J) colistin. The experiments were conducted independently on three separate trials. K , L SIM microscopy of E. coli cells treated with FITC-P33 (K, green channel) and stained with the amyloid dye HS169, a red-shifted version of pFTAA (L, red channel). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of 40,000 E. coli cells, treated with FITC-P33 for 10 minutes ( M ), 30 minutes (N) and 1 hour (O) . Cells were stained with Sytox for viability assessment and HS169 to monitor aggregation simultaneously. Full size image In the current study, we focused on the mode of action and broad-spectrum activity of P33 and discovered it causes aggregation of many proteins, with a bias towards transmembrane proteins and ribosomal components. Given the importance of this type of proteins as drug targets in broad-spectrum antibiotics, we screened for activity against other ESKAPE pathogens in which the targets are conserved and found broad-spectrum activity of our peptide, with a conserved mode of action across the tested spectrum. Although these linear hydrophobic peptides are challenging drug candidates, we obtained encouraging results in models of urinary tract infection and sepsis.",
