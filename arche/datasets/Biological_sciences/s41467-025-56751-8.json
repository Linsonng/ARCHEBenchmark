    "content": "Proteins play a vital role in various field, including medicine, chemical manufacturing, energy, agriculture, and consumer products. However, for industrial applications, proteins often require engineering to enhance properties such as stability, activity, selectivity, and binding affinity [1] , [2] . Numerous strategies have been developed for protein engineering, with directed evolution being a well-established and powerful approach [3] , [4] , [5] . Traditional directed evolution relies on iterative cycles of random mutagenesis and high-throughput screening to identify variants with desired traits. While effective, this process is time-consuming and labor-intensive [6] . Additionally, since directed evolution typically introduces one mutation at a time, it can be trapped in local fitness optima, limiting further improvement [7] , [8] . Recently, targeted mutagenesis guided by structure or sequence information has become a popular way to produce so-called small-but-smart libraries [9] . These libraries, which contain a higher ratio of beneficial mutations and fewer deleterious ones, improve the efficiency of directed evolution. For example, iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM) and CASTing methods have been effectively used for enzyme evolution, requiring screening of only moderate-sized libraries including 5000 to 20,000 variants [10] , [11] . However, the success of targeted mutagenesis is highly dependent on the choice of target site, which requires a deep understanding of the protein’s structure-function relationship [12] . Moreover, software tools such as Rosetta and HotSpot Wizard have shown promise in enzyme redesign and functional enhancement, but de novo enzyme design remains in its infancy, and these methods are generally effective only for relatively simple reactions [13] , [14] , [15] . Machine learning (ML) has recently emerged as a promising tool for exploring protein fitness landscapes [16] . One specific application, ML-assisted directed evolution (MLDE), employs supervised ML models to predict the fitness of protein variants that carry multiple mutations [17] , [18] . This technique facilitates larger jumps in protein sequence space, helping to bypass local optima that often occur in landscapes with strong epistasis. Bayesian optimization (BO), a method within active learning, is particularly well-suited for identifying protein variants with substantially improved fitness. Several studies have applied Gaussian process models with BO to optimize proteins. For instance, an iterative BO has demonstrated its effectiveness in enhancing thermostability of a P450 enzyme [19] . Similar methods have been applied to engineer activity a halogenase [20] , enantioselectivity of a putative nitric oxide dioxygenase [21] , fluorescence wavelength of green fluorescent protein (GFP) [22] and so forth. Despite these advances, the widespread application of ML in protein engineering remains challenging, in both acquiring and modeling protein function data. Experimentally collecting functional data is time-consuming and labor-intensive, particularly for enzymes with polyspecificity due to the substrate diversity and complexity [18] . Additionally, it was difficult to know how to efficiently sample and utilize informative protein mutants to train the ML models, especially for the protein without any prior information about the relationship between structure and function. Protein language models (PLMs) were trained on extensive datasets of protein sequences spanning the evolutionary tree of life, and hence learned the fundamental principles of protein structure and function. PLMs have proven powerful in modeling functional proteins [23] , predicting the direction of natural evolution [24] and designing novel proteins [25] . The captured knowledge in PLMs could be applied to “zero-shot” optimization of specific proteins. Affinity maturation of antibodies has been guided by PLMs, through which screening 20 or fewer variants improved the binding affinities up to 160-fold [26] . PLMs have also been used to assist optimization of an uracil-N-glycosylase variant activity that enables programmable T-to-G and T-to-C base editing [27] . However, a major open question is whether general evolutionary information learned from sequence variation across past evolution is sufficient to enable efficient evolution of a specific protein under specific selection pressure. Additionally, laboratory automation aided by biofoundries would be invaluable for generating the large volumes of data needed to develop ML models for protein engineering. A fully integrated biofoundry combines high-throughput core instruments, including liquid handlers, thermocyclers, fragment analyzers, and high-content screening systems, with peripheral devices such as plate sealers, shakers, and incubators. These components are seamlessly coordinated by robotic arms and scheduling software [28] . One example is PlasmidMaker which was developed for automated high-throughput plasmid design and construction [29] . Furthermore, the combination of biofoundries and ML models has led to the application of BioAutomata, an automated closed-loop system designed for engineering the lycopene production pathway [30] . An automated high-throughput genome editing platform was recently devised through which thousands of samples were automatically edited within a week [31] . However, protein engineering has yet to fully leverage recent developments in biofoundries. A so-called self-driving autonomous machine for protein landscape exploration (SAMPLE) platform was developed for fully autonomous protein engineering [32] . However, the platform only assembled pre-synthesized DNA fragments from different homologues for exploring a small protein landscape containing 1352 protein sequences. A Bayesian optimization-guided evolutionary algorithm along with robotic experiments were also developed for protein engineering, and a four-site combinatorial library was explored by sampling 384 mutants each round for 4 rounds, 1536 mutants in total [33] . However, the BO algorithm could not guide the mutant residue selection, and the generality of the algorithm remains unknown. In this study, we propose a protein engineering strategy that integrates the predictive power of PLMs with the operational efficiencies of an automated biofoundry. Within the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle, the Learning and Design phases utilize insights from PLMs to elucidate protein sequence-fitness relationships and to sample novel mutants, while the Build and Test phases are efficiently conducted using automated biofoundry. Specifically, when applying PLMs for protein variants design, two modules were developed to predict high-fitness mutants for proteins without knowing the mutation sites and the proteins with mutation sites known, respectively. Our robotic systems are adept at building protein variants and collecting protein variants functional data continuously, ensuring high reproducibility with comprehensive metadata tracking and real-time data sharing. By combining the advanced predictive capabilities of PLMs with the high-throughput functionalities of robotic systems, this method is designed to surpass traditional constraints and expedite the discovery and enhancement of proteins crucial for industrial applications. We used the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii p -cyanophenylalanine tRNA synthetase (pCNF-RS) as a model enzyme for validating the process. In each round, 96 variants were designed by PLMs or a supervised ML model, and then constructed and tested by an automated biofoundry. Four rounds were performed within half a month with the enzyme activity progressively improving, reaching its peak in the fourth round. The PLMeAE system exhibited superior performance compared to random selection and the traditional directed evolution strategy, and it has the potential to accelerate the engineering of other proteins.",
