    "content": "Transcription initiation, finely orchestrated by the highly conserved multi-subunit RNA polymerase (RNAP, α2ββ‘ωσ) and various transcription factors, serves as a critical pivot for the precise regulation of gene expression in bacteria in response to changing signals. Regarding host-keeping genes, the principal σ factor specifically recognizes the promoter consensus -10 and -35 elements through its conserved domains, σR2 and σR4, respectively [1] . These interactions are further enhanced by the conserved σR2-β‘ clamp helices (β‘ CH), σR4-β flap interactions, and potential αCTD-DNA or/and αCTD-σR4 interactions, which collectively promote the formation of an active RNAP-promoter open complex (RPo) to initiate transcription [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] . In the context of promoters containing suboptimal elements, the formation of RPo is facilitated by specific transcription activators that recruit RNAP or bend DNA to compensate for the weaker σ-DNA interactions compared to those occurred in one canonical RPo. Consequently, this activator-containing RPo is referred to as a transcription activation complex (TAC) [8] , [9] . As recently reviewed, transcription activators from the σ 70 family can be classified into four categories based on the positioning of their binding sites relative to the –35 element: Type I (upstream site), Type II (downstream site), Type III (no DNA binding), and Type IV (both upstream and downstream sites) [10] . Conversely, transcription initiation can be inhibited by transcription repressors that utilize mechanisms such as occlusion, DNA looping, or locking of RNAP to impede the function of either RNAP or the activators [9] , [11] . The complex formed in this scenario is termed a transcription repression complex (TRC). Notably, many transcription factors have been identified as either activators or repressors at different promoters, underscoring the intricate nature of finely tuned regulatory mechanisms. As being identified, a majority of OmpR/PhoB family response regulators (RRs), characterized by distinct winged-helix DNA binding motifs, function as dual functional transcription regulators [12] , [13] . Typically, RRs, in conjunction with their associated membrane-bound sensor kinases, form integral signaling cascades—known as two-component systems (TCSs). These systems facilitate the transient regulation of stress-responsive genes that enhance bacterial survival and pathogenicity [14] . Numerous studies have shown that the OmpR/PhoB family RRs are widely distributed among bacteria, particularly in notable pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), Vibrio cholerae ( Vch ) , Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Pae ), Escherichia coli ( Eco ) or the model bacteria Streptomyces coelicolor ( Sco ) [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] . As a representative member of the enormous OmpR/PhoB family, Mtb PhoP remodels the transcriptional network of Mtb by regulating over 100 genes involved in virulence, lipid biosynthesis, carbon metabolism, low pH, hypoxia, and stress response, functioning as both a global transcriptional activator and repressor [16] , [21] , [22] , [23] , [24] . Notably, the complex regulatory mechanisms of PhoP in response to phosphate starvation and its interplay with nitrogen availability have been documented [25] , [26] : PhoP not only activates the transcription of phosphate assimilation genes, including those for high-affinity phosphate-specific transport systems genes ( pstSCAB ) and the global phosphate starvation stress response modulator gene ( phoU ) [27] , [28] , [29] , but also represses the transcription of relevant dissimilation or other metabolic genes. For example, PhoP represses the nitrogen metabolism gene amtB through cross-talk with the global nitrogen metabolism regulator GlnR [30] , [31] , [32] . However, what determines PhoP to deferentially act as a dual transcriptional regulator remain inadequately understood. Structural based sequence alignment shows that Mtb PhoP shares high structural similarity with the other homologous members (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). It comprises a conserved N-terminal receiver domain (REC) and a C-terminal effective DNA binding domain (DBD). Biochemical assays indicate that phosphorylation of the REC by its cognate sensor kinase PhoR or by acetyl phosphate (AcP) enhances the DNA binding affinity of DBD [21] , [22] , [33] , [34] . The specific direct repeat units (DRus) PhoP binds are referred as PhoP binding boxes (PHO boxes), each of which carries two conserved PhoP binding sites (site a and site b) separated by several nucleotides (Fig. 1 ) [34] , [35] , [36] . The co-crystal structure of PhoP bound to a PHO box-containing promoter DNA reveals that a PhoP dimer interacts with the PHO box through conserved winged helices, akin to other transcription regulators in the OmpR/PhoB family [12] , [22] , [37] , [38] , [39] , [40] . These interactions facilitate a compact arrangement of the PhoP_RECs and PhoP_DBDs, which restricts a 4-bp spacer between the two binding sites [41] . Notably, PhoP is capable of regulating multiple PHO promoters that consists of two or more PHO boxes, a similar characteristic to its homolog PhoB [20] , [27] , [29] , [35] , [42] , [43] . The molecular details on how these PhoP-like OmpR/PhoB family regulators efficiently control such complex promoters remain to be elucidated.

According to the structures, the PhoP binding box, −35 element, -10 element is boxed with yellow, violet, and brown colors, respectively. a1 site, b1 site, a2 site, b2 site, a3 site and b3 site of the PhoP binding box are shaded with light orange, dark cyan, brown, cyan, purple, and dark green, respectively. The EM density maps are colored as indicated in the color key. NT, non-template-strand promoter DNA; T, template-strand promoter DNA. Full size image Here, we determine three cryo-EM structures of the PhoP-dependent transcription activation complexes (2PhoP-TAC, 4PhoP-TAC, 6PhoP-TAC) consisting of Mtb RNA polymerase (RNAP), Mtb PhoP, and the well-characterized consensus promoters including various numbers of PHO boxes, respectively. Structural comparisons of PhoP-TACs and the obtained Mtb RPo demonstrate that PhoP specifically recognizes promoter PHO boxes as either dimer or distinct tandem dimers (tetramer/hexamer). These downstream PhoP-DNA interactions displace the canonical interactions between the -35 element and σ A R4 of Mtb RNAP. Additionally, PhoP engages in substantial protein-protein interactions with the conserved domains (β flap and σ A R4) of RNAP. These indicate PhoP functions through diverse and complex transcription activation mechanisms. Based on the prior competitive identification of PhoP on the PhoP-GlnR cross-talked nitrogen assimilation promoter, the DNA binding characteristics of PhoP, and the cryo-EM map of PhoP-TRC obtained, we were able to build one preliminary cryo-EM structural model for the PhoP-dependent transcription repression complex (PhoP-TRC), which comprises Mtb RNAP, PhoP, GlnR, and their cross-talked nitrogen assimilation promoter DNA. Notably, PhoP is restrained in a unique repression mode within PhoP-TRC: competitive binding of the PhoP dimer to the upstream PHO box significantly distorts the DNA double-strands at the following spacer. This distortion creates substantial steric hinderances to impede the binding of a third GlnR dimer, thereby repressing GlnR-dependent transcription activation. Collectively, these structural and biochemical data shed new light on the dual molecular mechanisms underlying PhoP-dependent transcription regulation, and provide valuable insights for exploring the PhoP-like OmpR/PhoB family transcription regulators and target development.",
