    "content": "Many human autoimmune diseases are characterized by disease-specific autoantibodies. In most autoimmune diseases, like myasthenia gravis (MG), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), broadly B cell-targeting therapies are effective, indicating that B cells play a pivotal role in disease pathogenesis. Targeting B cells can also offer valuable insights into which B cell subsets contribute to disease. However, how B cells contribute to disease is often unknown. A profound mechanistic understanding of B cell involvement in disease pathogenesis is important, however, as broadly B cell depleting interventions carry substantial risks [1] . So far, studies have focused preferentially on disease-specific autoreactive IgG which is routinely assessed in clinical practice. Clearly, this has revealed prominent roles for autoreactive IgG in several B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. Also, it has provided the basis for emerging therapeutic approaches that target IgG, for example by enhancing IgG degradation through blockade of the neonatal Fcγ-receptor, FcRn [2] , [3] , [4] . A prototypic human autoimmune disease mediated by B cells is anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) [5] . AAV is hallmarked by the presence of disease-specific IgG and represents a group of severe systemic autoimmune diseases characterized by small vessel inflammation and organ-threatening tissue damage. To date, there is no known cure. Different ANCA-IgG associate with different clinical syndromes. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) most frequently associates with ANCA targeting proteinase 3 (PR3). ANCA targeting myeloperoxidase (MPO) hallmark microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and, less frequently, eosinophilic GPA (EGPA). The most severe AAV manifestations are alveolar hemorrhage and necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (NCGN). These often cause irreversible organ damage and can be life-threatening. The rise of ANCA-IgG often precedes relapses [6] . Associations between ANCA-IgG levels and disease activity are variable, however, and relapses remain common and are difficult to predict [6] , [7] , [8] . Current therapies targeting B cells and, more recently, the complement system, have considerably improved disease management [9] , [10] . Hence, it is assumed that B cells and especially autoreactive antibodies are crucially involved in disease pathogenesis. This notion is supported by copious evidence from clinical, in vivo and in vitro studies [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] . Nonetheless, most patients require long-term, extensive immunosuppressive treatment with considerable side effects. Consequently, infections now represent the main cause of death [19] , [20] . Therefore, it remains crucial to understand the specific pathophysiological role of B cells in both disease relapses and remission. ANCA and, in particular, anti-MPO-ANCA are thought to be directly pathogenic, as shown by passive transfer experiments in rodents [11] , [21] . Anti-MPO-IgG induced in mice deficient for the MPO gene, for example, mediated severe vasculitis with NCGN and pulmonary hemorrhage when injected into wild-type mice. In these models, the alternative pathway of the complement system was identified as a crucial mediator of anti-MPO-IgG induced pathogenicity, as animals deficient in C5 and factor B developed no disease [22] . In humans, the C5a receptor antagonist avacopan clearly improves disease [9] . Experiments deciphering in vivo pathogenicity of anti-PR3 antibodies have given varying results, possibly due to significant differences between human PR3 and its murine homologs [12] . Still, also multiple in vitro experiments with either patient serum, isolated IgG or murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have demonstrated direct effects of ANCA on neutrophils, such as the enhancement of neutrophil phagocytosis and cytokine production [13] , [14] . Additionally, ANCA increase adherence of neutrophils to, and cytotoxicity towards, endothelial cells [15] , [16] , [17] . Furthermore, ANCA-stimulated neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) containing MPO and PR3 autoantigens [18] and complement activating components [22] , leading to higher autoantigen exposure and possibly a positive feedback loop capable of amplifying inflammation. While the above provide clear evidence for functional pathogenicity of ANCA and highlight the challenges of maintaining remission, it has proven challenging to study specific B cell responses underlying ANCA production in human AAV. The biology of these cells, however, may hold important information as to their generation and dynamics of activation in the disease context and may help identify triggers that such cells might receive leading to their activation. Therefore, we here set out to characterize autoreactive, MPO-directed B cell responses in MPO + AAV patients. Previous work has indicated the presence of MPO-reactive B cells in the circulation of AAV patients, as assessed by detecting ANCA-IgG production by stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from AAV patients, including patients post-rituximab treatment or during remission [23] , [24] , [25] . Here, we perform an analysis of the anti-IgM B cell compartment and show that most MPO-directed B cells in the circulation of MPO + AAV patients are IgM-positive. Analyzing the anti-MPO-Ig response, we provide the first evidence that anti-MPO-IgM may have a prominent, so far unrecognized, function in disease pathogenesis. This function may relate to complement activation, as the complement activating capacity of anti-MPO Ig in human serum is strongly dependent on anti-MPO IgM. Together, these results are relevant for future management of disease relapses and the design of targeted therapies. Moreover, these results highlight IgM B cell autoreactivity as an important component of pathogenicity in human autoimmune diseases.",
