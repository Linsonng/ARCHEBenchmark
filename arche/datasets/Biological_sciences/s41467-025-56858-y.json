    "content": "Adoptive cellular transfer (ACT) has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach in oncology, enabling the precise targeting and elimination of cancer cells. However, the efficacy of ACT in solid tumors is often compromised by impaired CD8 + T cell functions, inadequate activation, and limited lifespan of tumor-reactive T cells [1] , [2] , [3] . The TCR-CD3 complex mediates the recognition of tumor antigens, initiating downstream signaling essential for a robust immune response. Yet, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment can inhibit CD8 + T cell activation and cytotoxicity, facilitating tumor immune evasion [4] , [5] , [6] . Unlike the immune checkpoint inhibitors, ACT relies on the ex vivo activation and expansion of T cells, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that this phase can influence the therapeutic efficacy of tumor-specific CD8 + T cells against cancer [7] , [8] , [9] . Hence, optimizing culture conditions and elucidating the underlying mechanisms are critical for broadening the clinical utility of ACT immunotherapy. T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation into effector and memory T cells are orchestrated by a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic signaling cascades, essential for combating malignancies and establishing durable protection [10] , [11] . Following T cell receptor (TCR) engagement, antigen recognition is reinforced by the formation of TCR clusters at the cell membrane [12] , [13] . This leads to the establishment of an immune synapse, which activates a series of transcription factors (TF), including early growth response 1 (EGR1), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and activator protein 1 (AP-1), driving the transcription of genes crucial for T cell effector function [14] , [15] . These TFs also regulate chromatin accessibility, thereby shaping T cell function and fate determination [16] , [17] . Identifying the molecular regulators that modulate TF activity and guide T cell specification is crucial for enhancing T cell-mediated antitumor responses. Among these TFs, EGR1 plays a pivotal role in CD8 + T cell responses. EGR1 is rapidly induced in T cells upon antigen receptor cross-linking or TCR stimulation, serving as a key mediator linking early TCR signaling to downstream gene expression [14] , [18] . Studies have demonstrated the importance of EGR1 in various T cell processes, including thymic development and the regulation of key cytokines such as IL-2 and TNF, as well as its crucial role in the clonal expansion of virus-specific CD8 + T cells in a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model [19] , [20] , [21] . Utilizing piezoelectric membrane materials, we demonstrate the role of electrical stimulation in accelerating bone regeneration and combating bacteria [22] , [23] . Building on this work, our study reveals that treatment with a charged substrate enhances EGR1 expression and increases chromatin accessibility at EGR1 binding sites in CD8 + T cells, driving proliferation and polarization. Importantly, we find that EGR1 activation is antigen-dependent, underscoring its role in shaping CD8 + T cell responses under different immune contexts. In most clinical settings, autologous CD8 + T cells are genetically modified to express transgenic antigen receptors, followed by a brief period of in vitro activation and expansion before being reinfused into the patient. Efforts to improve T cell functionality typically focus on biological or chemical interventions [24] , [25] , [26] , [27] . While biochemical factors influencing T cell regulation have been extensively studied, the role of biophysical cues, such as shear stress, solid stress, and matrix stiffness, is increasingly recognized as critical in CD8 + T cell activation [8] , [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] . These physical characteristics can independently or synergistically impact the tumor microenvironment and the efficacy of CAR-T cells. Moreover, membrane potential (MP) depolarization in T cells within tumor microenvironments or inflamed tissues has been shown to affect receptor mobility, while characteristic oscillations at immunological synapses and electrostatic interactions in TCR signaling regulation have been observed [32] , [33] , [34] , [35] , [36] . However, the mechanisms by which electrical signals are converted into biochemical signaling within T cells and whether external electrical stimulation can be used to modulate T cell activity in cancer therapy, remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that external electrical stimulation during ex vivo culture refines CD8 + T cell differentiation, enhancing the efficacy of ACT or CAR-T therapy in vivo. By augmenting TCR signaling transduction, electrical stimulation reduces the polarization of virtual memory T cells and promotes the expansion of CD8 + T cells with higher proliferative potential, key factors in the antitumor effects of ACT. Our findings highlight the critical role of extracellular electrical stimuli in shaping CD8 + T cell fate, providing a foundational strategy for harnessing proliferative potential T cells in cancer therapy.",
