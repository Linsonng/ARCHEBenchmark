    "content": "Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-associated diseases are an emerging global epidemic [1] , [2] . The role of HPV-6 and HPV-11 in the etiology of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), the most common benign tumor of the laryngeal epithelium, is well-established [3] , [4] . RRP lesions can occur in the oropharynx, larynx, and elsewhere in the respiratory tract [5] , significantly impacting voice production and even breathing in severe cases. Rarely, papillomas can undergo malignant transformation in the pulmonary tract, most notably in the pulmonary parenchyma [6] . RRP is a chronic, debilitating disease that is associated with substantial patient burden. Repeated surgical removal of papillomas for symptomatic management remains the mainstay of treatment and can result in significant morbidity considering the number of surgical procedures required, impact on voice, effects of repetitive anesthesia, as well as psychological impact, and financial burden [7] . Additionally, the risk of laryngeal injury increases with each surgery [8] . Current treatment of HPV-6- and HPV-11-related RRP could be improved with the addition of HPV-specific immunotherapy, which has the therapeutic potential to control or eliminate papillomas by generating immunity against HPV itself. Patients suffering from RRP have been characterized as exhibiting suppressive or regulatory immune-related functions within papillomas, as opposed to mounting a cytotoxic response against HPV infected cells [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] . Our previous studies of DNA immunotherapies directed against HPV have demonstrated the induction of potent immune responses for HPV in a pilot trial of adults with HPV-6-related RRP and in HPV-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma as well as cervical disease, inclusive of the generation of HPV-specific cytotoxic T-cells as well as CD8+ immune cell infiltration into tumors [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] . Additionally, other groups have conducted clinical studies of RRP treatment from an immunological approach via antibody and T-cell-related platforms, with results that support an immune-based impact on disease state [19] , [20] . INO-3107 is a DNA immunotherapy encoding for antigens from both HPV-6 and HPV-11 as well as encoding for an interleukin-12 (IL-12) immune adjuvant. Here, we report full study results from a DNA-based therapy in development for RRP from a completed Phase 1/2 trial demonstrating the safety, efficacy, and immune responses of INO-3107.",
