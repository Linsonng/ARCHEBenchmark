    "content": "Most bacteria exhibit little growth in their natural environments, with nutrient limitation being a typical causative factor [1] . Therefore, how bacteria catabolise environmental macromolecules and import the resulting nutrients is of general importance for a broader understanding of microbial growth [2] , [3] . Bacteria typically transport small peptides into the cell to serve as a source of fixed nitrogen and amino acids [4] . This transport is exploited in laboratory microbial culture when casein (the predominant protein component of milk) degraded with enzymes (a casein hydrolysate) is used as a source of nutrients for growth. Prior degradation is necessary because whole proteins are typically too large for bacterial uptake, enzyme degradation produces amino acids and small peptides that can be transported into the bacterium to be used for growth, for example in the almost universally used LB broth culture medium [5] . Casein hydrolysate gives a dose-dependent enhancement of wild type Escherichia coli growth when used as an additive to minimal media with glycerol as a carbon source (Fig. 1a ). In line with this observation, one may expect that the proteins released from the lysis of dead bacteria in the environment must be catabolised to small peptides before they can support the growth of other live cells. Here, we show that this is indeed the case and demonstrate the Lon protease released from dead cells catabolises co-released proteins to small peptide nutrients. Further, we suggest how such post-mortem protein lysate processing could have evolved.
