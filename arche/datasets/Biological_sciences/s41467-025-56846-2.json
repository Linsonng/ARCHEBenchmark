    "content": "The concept of modularity is widely used in a plethora of scientific and engineering disciplines [1] . Modularity divides structures or systems into subunits, that can be independently addressed and changed, without affecting the rest of the structure or system. Subunits may even be reusable for different structures or systems. This allows for low-effort, cost-effective assembly of, e.g. buildings [2] , hardware (through standardization of subparts), machine code (also: object-oriented programming) or genetic code [3] . In nature, well-defined subunits of only a few nm in size [4] assemble into higher-order structures [5] , [6] with sizes ranging from a few hundred nanometers (nm) to several micrometers (µm). As synthetic biology progresses, researchers aim to mimic such structures, both on a molecular and on a cellular level. Therefore, the need for modular building blocks capable of controllably assembling and disassembling into and from higher-order structures on biologically relevant time scales has become more urgent. Structural DNA nanotechnology has become a widely used construction approach in synthetic biology. Especially the DNA origami [7] technique, where a long, circular scaffold strand, extracted from the M13mp18 bacteriophage, is folded into any desired 2D or 3D shape using short synthetic staple strands, presents an indispensable tool for nanoscale engineering. DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) ranging from just a few nm to over a hundred nm can be easily designed and synthesized, with freely available CAD software such as caDNAno [8] . To date a large variety of DONs have been published, ranging from the simplest 2D structures [7] to functional DNA origami motors [9] . A very attractive feature of DONs is their complete addressability for guest molecule placement with base pair (bp) precision, enabling e.g. the formation of fluorescent nanorulers [10] , plasmonic nanosensors [11] , [12] , nm-sized force sensors [13] , [14] , or to study complex biological questions [15] , [16] , [17] . Despite all of these advantages, a bottleneck in DON design is the overall final size limit, determined by the scaffold strand (the M13mp18 genome is made up of 7249 bases). Although different insertions have led to scaffold sizes of close to 9000 bases, the overall size increase in 3D DONs is marginal. Therefore, a variety of different strategies have been reported to increase DON sizes. These include the use of a lambda/M13 hybrid phage as a scaffold source [18] , the development of orthogonal scaffold strands [19] , the use of unscaffolded structures [20] , [21] , [22] , origami slats [23] , [24] , or hierarchical assembly into finite [25] , [26] or periodic [26] , [27] , [28] structures. Each of these methods has at least one major drawback: With the lambda/M13 hybrid phage, synthesis of scaffolds larger than 50 000 bases [18] , equivalent to ~six regular origami was achieved. A similar size was achieved with superstructures from orthogonal scaffolds, reaching sizes equivalent to five regular origami. However, both approaches have similar bottlenecks: Firstly, the effort for scaffold production is increased tremendously and secondly, the unique scaffold sequence requires the same amount of unique staples to be designed and synthesized individually, increasing effort and monetary cost proportionally to superstructure size. The latter problem also affects unscaffolded nanostructures employing single-stranded tile (SST) assembly, where every ssDNA tile needs to be designed and synthesized individually. Nonetheless, using 10,000 unique ssDNA tiles, superstructures in the Gigadalton (GDa) scale have been constructed [22] . The largest superstructures reported to date were constructed using so-called DNA origami slats [24] , through connection of several long 6 or 12 helix bundles (HBs) via well-positioned, complementary ssDNA handles. These structures reached several µm and GDa in size and their synthesis is comparably cost effective. However, assembly is so far limited to planar 2D structures with low degrees of complexity in assembly. Yet it is the most efficient strategy reported to date for these kinds of large, flat and fully addressable superstructures. Another approach is the construction of superstructures with ssDNA connectors [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] . With this approach, different 3D shapes of superstructures can be constructed, but each connection requires many unique ssDNA connectors, making it susceptible to unwanted interactions and incomplete connections. GDa sizes can also be reached through hierarchical assembly, where successively larger structures are assembled in multiple subsequent steps. This approach has led to structures measuring 0.5 µm (2D), depicting a μm-sized image of the Mona Lisa [33] , while 3D structures could reach up to the GDa scale [25] . The high structural control and potential size make it an excellent approach for the formation of superstructures. Nevertheless, design and construction are faced with different challenges. For the hierarchical assembly of superstructures, connectivity always faces one of two problems: On the one hand, assemblies of self-complementary DONs lead to repetitive, homomultimeric finite [25] or periodic [26] , [27] superstructures. This approach is simple and cost-effective, as in principle only one type of monomer is required. However, it has the great disadvantage of an overall loss of structural control of the superstructure beyond the repetitive subunit, as only form and size of the subunit is controlled, yet superstructure formation occurs without control over the final structure. Consequently, it is impossible to controllably retain the site-specific addressability of the structure beyond the single monomer or subunit. On the other hand, assemblies made up of many different DONs, each complementary to one another, but not themselves, yield finite, heteromultimeric superstructures [9] , [19] . With this approach the structural control over the superstructure is high and the site-specific addressability is retained. However, the downsides are the requirement for a multitude of different DONs, leading to high design effort and increasing costs, proportional to superstructure size, and/or the need to be assembled in several steps, resulting in a tremendous decrease in overall yield. Therefore, currently, concepts combining both low cost and high structural versatility are missing. Such concepts could alleviate the issues associated with traditional hierarchical assembly and allow for the controlled assembly of large superstructures, or a multitude of orthogonal smaller structures, with retained site-specific addressability across the entire superstructure. In response to this challenge, we developed two methods for modularity and combined them in one structure, the moDON, a single modular DNA origami formed from one set of staples, but capable of folding into tens of thousands of different connection configurations. The large number of orthogonal connection sites allows us to increase the number of monomers in one-pot assemblies, circumventing the extraction and purification of intermediates as generally required in traditional hierarchical assembly. We were able to controllably assemble and disassemble manifolds of moDONs into large superstructures as well as smaller, more complex structures, in the xy- as well as in the z-plane. We engineered modularity into two different connection methods. The first method of modularity, in xy-direction, was created for shape-matching connection sites [25] , [26] . We achieved the multitude of connection sites by engineering a re-routable scaffold. Until now DNA origami was designed under the paradigm of creating one single, fixed scaffold routing for each structure. With this method alone, we were able to construct hundreds of individual moDON monomers with different shape-matching connection sites. The second method of modularity is a three-strand connection system in the z-direction. Here we engineered orthogonal binding sites with well-positioned, directional, and optimally sized handles, circumventing the problems occurring in other three-strand-systems, lacking rigidity, losing control over connection stoichiometry, and/or the impractical use of many different unique strands for each connection. The z-connections were engineered to be directional, non-branching, not self-passivating, removable, rigid, orthogonal, with a low number of duplexes per connection, and only made up of one single DNA sequence per connection site. Together with the xy-connections, this allowed for the construction of > 50 000 unique moDON monomers. We demonstrate the construction of arbitrary finite superstructures with connections in three dimensions. Additionally, we created periodic structures with monomeric and multimeric repetitive subunits reaching more than 1 GDa in size. Superstructures could be assembled in one-step reactions from monomers, without the need for purification and isolation of intermediate products, which is required in traditional hierarchical assembly. This greatly simplifies construction and simultaneously increases the overall yield. Further, we show that xy- and z-connections are fully orthogonal allowing for parallel and selective assembly and disassembly of each individual connection using different orthogonal triggers (see Figure S1 for overview). Finally, we show that the site-specific addressability of each monomer in the superstructure is fully retained by placing gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) at specific positions in the superstructures, demonstrating a highly controllable, efficient, and cost-effective strategy for the formation of large and orthogonal superstructures.",
