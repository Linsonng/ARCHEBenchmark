    "content": "Expansion microscopy (ExM) [1] physically magnifies preserved biological specimens by covalently anchoring biomolecules and/or their labels to a swellable polymer network (such as sodium polyacrylate) synthesized in situ throughout a specimen, followed by chemical softening of the sample, and the addition of water to swell the hydrogel. As the hydrogel swells, the anchored biomolecules and/or their labels are pulled apart from each other isotropically, typically to a physical magnification of ~4-10x in each linear dimension. With an iterative form of ExM [2] , [3] , the expanded sample can be expanded a second time, resulting in an overall physical magnification of beyond 10x in each linear dimension. The net result of the expansion is that biomolecules and/or their labels that are initially localized within the diffraction limit of a traditional optical microscope can now be separated in space to distances far enough to resolve them. Expansion microscopy protocols are increasingly prevalent in biology for visualizing proteins [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] , nucleic acids [9] , [10] , [11] , and membrane or lipids [6] , [7] , [8] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] . ExM also enables the visualization of anatomical features of specimens through dense labeling of total protein [4] , [7] , [8] via N -hydroxyl succinimide (NHS) ester staining. While several ExM methods have been reported for membrane or lipid labeling and visualization [6] , [7] , [8] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , achieving dense labeling in fixed tissues has remained challenging (Supplementary Table 1 ). Ideally, one would enable uniform and continuous membrane labeling, yielding a high signal-to-background ratio, in order to preserve ultrastructure alongside visualization of associated proteins, in fixed tissues. Such a membrane labeling method would enable not just imaging of proteins with nanoscale registration relevant to membrane landmarks, but facilitate the segmentation and tracing of membranous structures, such as axons and dendrites, on a confocal microscope. Here, we report a strategy to achieve the set of features described above. We rationally and systematically designed innovative membrane labeling probes, and optimized the ExM protocol, to achieve dense labeling of membranes, including plasma membranes, with ExM. We found that our probe, in the context of ExM, labels plasma membranes, mitochondrial membranes, nuclear membranes, ciliary membranes, myelin sheaths, and extracellular vesicle membranes in fixed mouse brain tissue (Supplementary Table 1 ). We named our protocol ultrastructural membrane expansion microscopy (umExM), using the word ultrastructure in the same sense as an earlier protocol in the expansion microscopy community, called ultrastructure expansion microscopy [17] . umExM preserves ultrastructure and enables the visualization of membranous structures in 100 µm-thick slices of fixed mouse brain at a resolution of ~60 nm with excellent uniformity and continuity of membrane labeling as well as a high signal-to-background ratio (40-80 fold higher than background). umExM could support co-visualization of membranous structures along with proteins and RNAs. The dense membrane labeling of umExM enabled the segmentation of neuronal compartments (e.g., cell bodies, dendrites, and axons), and tracing of neuronal processes (e.g., axons). Finally, we explored combining umExM with optical fluctuation imaging, as well as an iterative form of umExM that achieves a higher expansion factor, enabling ~35 nm resolution imaging of membranes with a standard confocal microscope. We anticipate umExM to have a variety of uses in neuroscience and biology, for the investigation of ultrastructure, cellular compartments, and molecular content, in intact tissues, with nanoscale precision.",
