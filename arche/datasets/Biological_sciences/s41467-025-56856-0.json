    "content": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the most widely used techniques for the selective amplification of target oligonucleotide molecules in complex library, identified by specific primer sequences [1] , [2] . PCR facilitates the selective amplification of both biological DNA and synthetic oligos from complex libraries containing millions of distinct sequences [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] . For effective PCR, each target subset must possess a unique selection region for primer pairs, comprising forward and reverse primers ~ 20 nucleotides (nt) in length, to ensure the specificity of primer hybridization [7] . Despite advancements, including the optimization of primer design and the incorporation of molecular probe-based mechanisms, the specificity of selecting oligos still largely depends on the length of the unique region for hybridization [8] . Also, users must identify the selection regions within the target and synthesize the corresponding primer pairs, with the synthesis burden increasing in proportion to the number of subsets [9] . In addition to PCR, other nucleic acid amplification, enrichment, and selection methods, such as hybridization-based capture and the CRISPR system, rely on hybridization and share this dependency on the length of the unique selection region [7] , [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] . Consequently, the scalability of current oligo-selection methods is limited. In addition, given that the current length limit for de novo oligonucleotide synthesis is 200 nt, dedicating 40 nt to the selection region regardless of the number of oligo subsets is inefficient [7] , [16] , [19] , [20] , [21] . To prevent library depletion during repeated subset selection, it is essential to enable oligo library amplification, which requires an additional 40 nt replication region where universal primers bind [7] , [13] , [22] . Although recent biotechnological advancements have expanded the scale by exploring diverse nucleic acid libraries, primer requirements have constrained these efforts. Furthermore, despite the introduction of multiplexed target selection methods, such as multiplexed PCR, which aim to select multiple oligo subsets in a single reaction, the requirement for primer synthesis proportionally increases with the number of target subsets, posing a bottleneck [9] , [22] , [23] . Here, we introduce a highly efficient method for selecting oligo subsets that can recognize barcodes in single-nucleotide resolutions, eliminating the need for individual primers for each subset. Through the implementation of synthesis and selection, which involves single-nucleotide resolution cyclic DNA synthesis and blocking of template oligos, we successfully demonstrated oligo subset selection with only a few nucleotides and without primer synthesis for each oligo subset. This advancement enables the application of a hierarchical data structure to oligo subsets, similar to the management of digital data in computer science, where data are organized into files with directories for streamlined searching, thereby facilitating the efficient selection of multiple subsets. The introduction of single-nucleotide resolution barcode identification through synthesis and selection enabled the development of a programmable and scalable directory system within a complex oligo library (Fig. 1 ). Theoretically, four to the power of N oligo subsets can be encoded by N nt, with four possible bases in each nucleotide. Thousands of oligo subsets can be identified using only 6 nt of selection region (4 6 ) – referred to as a “barcode” in our proposed method – reducing the complexity of primer design compared to PCR-based methods that require unique primer pairs for each subset [7] (Fig. 1a ). Moreover, the proposed method allows the selection of oligo subsets in a hierarchical manner. Because the synthesis- and selection-based approach involves cyclic reactions, higher groups in the hierarchy can be selected with fewer cycles. For example, if oligo subsets are encoded with a 3 nt barcode, three cycles of selection with sequences A, T, and G permit the selection of a single subset. However, if the selection stops after the 2nd cycle with barcodes A and T, the four subsets within the ATN barcode can be simultaneously selected. The proposed hierarchical selection contrasts with PCR-based selection, where the amplification of a subset exhibits a one-to-one correspondence between the primer and oligo subset, resulting in a planar and non-hierarchical structure [22] , [23] , [24] . Fig. 1: Synthesis and selection-based oligo selection enables 4 N subsets access with N nucleotide region and a hierarchical structure in complex oligo library. a Oligo library subset selection employing a hierarchical structure. Accessing a higher level of the hierarchy enables reaching all the oligo subsets below it. The DNA sequence-based barcoding system utilizes four base types and employs a quaternary barcode-based method for representing directories. By contrast, traditional PCR-based oligo selection requires a one-to-one mapping of specific primers to oligo subsets. The hierarchical structure within the oligo library demonstrates scalability through reduced nucleotide length requirements and improved programmability in oligo selection. b Details of the oligo selection include single-base resolution synthesis and selection cycles on the complementary template oligo strands. During synthesis and selection, nucleotides matching the target directory are introduced with reversible terminators, such as 3’-O-azidomethyl deoxynucleotides, while others are coupled with irreversible terminators, such as dideoxynucleotides. By repeating the cycles after deprotecting the reversible terminators, only the oligos with target barcodes will be retrieved. Full size image The proposed synthesis and selection-based oligo selection involves cyclic coupling of specific types of nucleotides with reversible terminators (such as 3’-O-azidomethyl deoxynucleotides) that match the target directory barcode, while others are coupled with nucleotides with irreversible terminators (such as dideoxynucleotides) (Fig. 1b , see Methods for detail). The original oligo library was immobilized onto solid substrates, such as magnetic beads, which facilitated the replacement of reagents during selection cycles. The selection process began with the hybridization of a primer complementary to the universal primer region. Following hybridization, two-step cycles continue until the desired barcode is reached. First, various combinations of nucleotides with reversible and irreversible terminators are introduced. For example, to select a single barcode A, a reversible terminator corresponding to the complementary T and irreversible terminators corresponding to A, C, and G were employed. Second, the blocker of the reversible terminator was removed using tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride treatments, enabling subsequent reactions. As a result, oligos that do not align with the target barcode are coupled with irreversible terminators and become incapable of further reactions. After identification of all barcodes, target oligo subsets were retrieved by denaturation from the original template, following the elongation with dNTPs to synthesize full-length oligos (See Methods for detail).",
