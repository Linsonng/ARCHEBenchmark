    "content": "The morphogenesis of epithelia displays remarkable plasticity and robustness during embryo development: living tissues actively remodel their shape while maintaining their structural integrity to establish functional organisms. Tissue remodelling relies on the ability of epithelial cells to generate mechanical forces and to acquire new shape and position while maintaining cell-cell contacts [1] , [2] . To achieve this, cells remodel their cytoskeleton in an orchestrated fashion [3] , [4] , [5] under the control of signalling cues established both at the local and organismal levels [6] . An outstanding example of epithelial plasticity and robustness is composite morphogenesis, the process by which an epithelial tissue undergoes multiple and simultaneous shape transformations [7] . For instance, epithelia can simultaneously fold and extend to drive embryo gastrulation, neurulation or tubulogenesis [8] , [9] , [10] . While great advances have been made to unveil the mechanisms underlying single morphogenetic processes, how composite morphogenesis is directed and coordinated is largely unexplored. To tackle this question, we study the concomitant folding and extension of the prospective mesoderm during early Drosophila gastrulation. Recent work has shown that mesoderm epithelial cells establish two junctional tiers formed by actomyosin networks tethered to E-cadherin and tailored for distinct functions. The first tier is apically located and mediates cell apical constriction for tissue furrowing (Fig. 1a, b and b’, bottom) [11] . The second tier is positioned laterally ( ~ 10 µm from the apical side) and is planar cell polarized to initiate cell intercalation for tissue convergence-extension (Fig. 1a, b and b’, top) [8] . With this study, we aim to shine light on the mechanisms that spatio-temporally coordinate the formation of functionally distinct cytoskeletal networks for simultaneous cell shape and topology changes. While the two tiers share the same nature, their origin differs. The first tier is under the control of the cell apical-basal polarity [12] and it is shaped by apical-medial actomyosin contractions [13] . The second tier is formed by the coalescence of the cell lateral actomyosin network, focusing E-cadherin to form a cluster [8] . Overall, the formation of the two-tier junctional system is under the control of the synergistic interaction between the embryo anterior-posterior (AP) and dorsal-ventral (DV) gene patterning systems [8] . How the lateral actomyosin network is spatio-temporally controlled is still unknown.

Full size image In addition to the molecular signalling, the change in position and shape of cellular organelles play a role in cell remodelling [14] , [15] . During the phase of apical constriction of mesoderm epithelial cells, the cell nuclei migrate basally [16] , [17] . While a great body of work has highlighted the mechanisms controlling nuclear relocation and the role of nuclear mechanotransduction in cell polarity, migration, division, or fate determination [18] , [19] , [20] , how the position of the nucleus participates in tissue remodelling remains elusive. We now investigate this during mesoderm folding and extension. We provide evidence that the nucleus functions as a cellular compartmentalizer and that its relocation spatio-temporally organizes the cell cytoskeleton and the distribution of the Rho guanine exchange factor RhoGEF2 to establish a second actomyosin tier for cell intercalation. Overall, by implementing advanced live imaging, laser manipulation, optogenetics, and molecular modelling, this study reveals the mechanisms underlying the spatiotemporal control of the cortical actomyosin cytoskeleton to form a modular scaffold for simultaneous morphogenetic events.",
