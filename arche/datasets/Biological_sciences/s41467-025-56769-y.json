    "content": "Rice ( Oryza sativa ) is one of the most important crops, cultivated in more than 100 countries and regions [1] . However, it confronts persistent threats from a wide range of diseases, with global yield losses attributed to pathogens and pests reaching up to 30% [2] . Especially viral diseases, which are often caused by insect-borne viruses, such as rice tungro viruses, rice Dwarf Virus (RDV), Rice Gall Dwarf Virus (RGDV), Rice Grassy Stunt Virus (RGSV), Rice Ragged Stunt Virus (RRSV) and Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), alongside their insect vectors, such as leafhoppers and planthoppers, wreaked havoc on rice production in East, South, and Southeast Asia [3] , [4] , [5] . Of particular concern is that these insect-borne viruses sporadically lead to devastating epidemics, often with unclear origins [6] . Therefore, the surrounding wild plants were deemed to be associated with rice viruses, due to their potential to act as reservoirs or intermediates for crop viruses [7] , [8] . Recent discoveries, exemplified by the identification of rice tiller inhibition virus (RTIV), a novel insect-borne positive-strand RNA virus found in wild rice through metagenomic sequencing, underscore the possibility of spillover from wild rice to cultivated rice [6] . Also noteworthy is that some insect-borne viruses can suddenly disseminate with minimal or no overt symptoms in the early stages, poses significant challenges to viral disease prevention [3] , [4] . Currently, 20 viruses are known to infect rice plants, predominantly inducing overt disease and characterized by RNA genomes, signifying the prevalence of RNA viruses in rice akin to other plants [3] , [4] . However, recent studies also showed that several novel viruses resembling insect viruses were associated with rice plants, and they appeared to cause dwarfing or curling symptoms [9] , [10] . These findings prompt a reassessment of the breadth and depth of rice viruses, suggesting that our current understanding may fall short, with additional viruses potentially lurking overtly or covertly within rice ecosystems. Viral metagenomics has emerged as a potent tool for uncovering hidden viruses without prior knowledge, offering ample coverage to reconstruct complete or near-complete viral genomes and facilitating straightforward characterization of viral diversity [11] , [12] . In the recent decade, viral metagenomics has been used to explore the viral diversity in plants [13] , animals [14] , prokaryotes [15] , pollen [16] , soil [17] , aquatic environments [18] and ocean [19] . In addition, the public sequencing database (SRA, Sequence Read Archive) has experienced exponential growth annually, and they probably contain viral nucleic acids that were inadvertently captured for their original purpose [20] . Therefore, viral metagenomic approaches were also applied to these data resource for the mining of related viruses and other pathogens [21] , [22] . Particularly, RNA viruses, characterized by the hallmark gene RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), exhibit a notable degree of conservation in both protein sequences and structures [23] . Accordingly, a variety of RdRP-based searching strategies, such as profile HMM (hidden Markov model) searching [24] , RdRP structural alignment [24] , and “plamprint” (the three essential motifs A, B and C forming the catalytic core in RdRP) scanning [22] , [25] , were developed, facilitating the rapid detection of RNA viruses. Furthermore, the detection of virus-derived sRNAs and negative strand RNAs has uncovered highly divergent viruses, such as Quenyavirus in Drosophila [26] and ORFan Mycovirus in powdery mildew [27] , from contigs commonly referred as “dark matter”, devoid of similarities with any reference nucleotide or amino acid sequences [28] . By contrast, although viral metagenomics has been utilized to identify viruses in rice plants, earlier investigations have struggled with small sample sizes, leading to a limited scope of virus identification [6] , [9] , [10] . To date, RNA viruses have been classified into over 6000 species according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV, https://ictv.global/taxonomy/ ), displaying extraordinary genetic diversity. Recently, the Serratus project conducted a massive analysis of all public RNA-seq data released before January 2021 in the SRA database, resulting in the identification of RdRP for over 10 5 RNA viruses, thereby significantly expanding viral diversity [22] . However, the viral RdRP information provided by Serratus typically represents only a fraction of complete RdRP domains, often insufficient for genome annotation and phylogenetic analysis. Nevertheless, this fragmentary RdRP information from Serratus proves valuable for screening appropriate RNA-seq libraries for virus identification, laying the groundwork for more specialized, in-depth analyses such as viral genome assembly, annotation, and classification [29] , [30] . Being one of the most crucial food crops, rice has long been a focal point of research, resulting in the accumulation of vast amounts of publicly available RNA-seq data submitted by scientists worldwide. However, up to now, these data have not undergone systematic analysis for virus identification. Besides, rice plants have long been threatened by fungal pathogens and insect pests, and the identification of viruses associated with these fungi or insects may offer valuable insights for developing innovative strategies to prevent both fungal infections and insect infestations. In this study, we conducted a large-scale analysis of 17,115 RNA-seq libraries encompassing 24 Oryza species to explore viral diversity in rice plants. Employing both homology-based and homology-independent approaches, we identified 810 complete or near-complete viruses and additional 49 RdRPs. Furthermore, we analyzed the metadata of SRA runs from Serratus, and estimated viral abundance in rice samples, facilitating the screening of 427 viruses closely associated with rice plants. These findings hold significant potential for advancing viral research, enhancing surveillance efforts against viral diseases, and implementing effective measures to mitigate viral epidemics in rice plants.",
