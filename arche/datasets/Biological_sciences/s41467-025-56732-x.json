    "content": "Pesticides are used globally to support agricultural production and protect human and animal health in both domestic and commercial situations [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] . At sufficient environmental concentrations, insecticide, fungicide and herbicide exposure can affect non-target organisms by disrupting their survival, growth, reproduction and behaviour (e.g. detection of stimuli), as well as effects on other metabolic and physiological processes (e.g. biomarkers of neural function or immunity, cellular respiration, photosynthesis) [9] . Some of the negative impacts of pesticides are known. For example, fungicides may decrease the biomass of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, affecting their symbioses with higher plants [10] ; herbicides may reduce plant pollen viability [11] and carbohydrate metabolism [12] ; insecticides (targeting pest herbivores) may cause long-term declines in non-target insect pollinators associated with mass-flowering crops [13] . Such impacts appear widespread across taxa, with individual studies reporting effects on microorganisms [14] , plants [15] , invertebrates [5] , [16] , [17] , amphibians [18] , birds [6] , [19] and mammals [20] . In addition to effects on individual species, the influence of pesticides can propagate across trophic levels, impacting ecosystem-scale species interactions that may lead to secondary effects [21] . Often due to practical constraints, pesticide regulatory risk assessments remain focused on a limited number of easily cultured model species, e.g. rats, zebrafish, Xenopus , Daphnia , chironomids, algae, honeybees, and/or earthworms. As such, they are unlikely to capture the variety of responses to pesticide exposure seen across the diversity of species and communities found in both managed and natural systems [13] . At the same time, there remains significant debate among the agricultural industry, governmental bodies and conservation organizations concerning the real-world hazards posed by pesticides. A major factor affecting the resolution of this issue is the lack of a cross-taxa synthesis of pesticide effects. Such an analysis is needed to support a robust evidence base for non-target effects that extend beyond scenario-specific case studies and model species. Previous meta-analyses of pesticide impacts on non-target species have either considered only particular taxonomic groups, such as fish [22] or bees [23] , or have considered specific habitats such as aquatic ecosystems [24] . To our knowledge, there has been no systematic and overarching synthesis of how different types of pesticides affect the diversity of multiple non-target eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms across all trophic levels. Furthermore, current syntheses have not considered how the impacts of pesticides differ globally across climatic zones or for major mechanisms of exposure, such as those acting in aquatic or terrestrial environments. Without a unified synthesis applying common data capture and analytical standards, the global consequences of pesticide use across diverse ecosystems and taxa remain poorly understood. Such knowledge derived from a careful quantitative synthesis is vital to inform national and international policy goals to provide a framework for targeted mitigation to identify the role of pesticide use in biodiversity declines. Here, we address these limitations by integrating 20,212 estimates of pesticide effects reported from 1705 experimental studies across the globe. These studies collectively measured the effects of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides on animals (invertebrates and vertebrates), plants (dicotyledonous, monocotyledonous and spore-producing) and microorganisms (bacteria and fungi). The included studies encompass laboratory and field experiments from temperate and tropical climatic zones, both in aquatic and terrestrial systems (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1 ). We classified the effects on multicellular animals (vertebrates and invertebrates), plants and microorganisms based on changes in growth, reproduction, and behaviour (animals only) as well as other relevant biomarkers (e.g. enzymatic activities, metabolic reaction and plant photosynthesis). For all meta-analyses, we explicitly accounted for phylogenetic effects for species where published phylogenies were available ( Supplementary Methods ). As well as considering the consequences of taxa-specific pesticides (e.g. effect of herbicides on plants), we also address potential pathways by which pesticides can affect non-target organisms. This includes impacts on taxonomic groups for which a particular class of pesticide was not developed to control, e.g. insecticides affecting fungi or plants. Further, we assess whether ‘new’ or ‘old’ pesticides, based on the rigorous European Union (EU) regulatory framework, differ in their effects. To do this, we applied meta-regression of log response ratios (lnRR) to test our hypotheses that: (i) pesticides (insecticides, fungicides and herbicides) suppress growth, reproduction, and behavioural traits; (ii) metabolic biomarkers of non-target organisms may be up- or down-regulated in response to pesticides, thus signalling a physiological perturbation; (iii) identified pesticide effects are consistent between taxonomic groups, experimental types, climatic zones, modes of exposure (terrestrial or aquatic), and broad pesticide classes (insecticides, fungicides or herbicides); and (iv) the effects also hold under realistic terrestrial and aquatic exposure scenarios. Fig. 1: Global distribution of study locations of pesticide impact on non-target organisms. Study locations across the globe are shown (world map in World Robinson projection). A literature search identified study locations for insecticide impact on animals (820 locations), plants (112 locations) and microorganisms (56 locations), for fungicide impact on animals (148 locations), plants (74 locations) and microorganisms (52 locations), and for herbicide impact on animals (286 locations), plants (161 locations) and microorganisms (69 locations), respectively, from a total of 1705 published articles from 1497 locations. Nineteen articles included more than one study location (range 2–5). Grey and non-English literature were not included in this meta-analysis. Map © ARCGIS Software.
