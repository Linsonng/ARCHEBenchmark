    "content": "Human respiratory viruses such as influenza virus (IV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are important causes of severe respiratory infections [1] . Previous reports showed that most of the common respiratory viruses, including IV, RSV, parainfluenza virus (PIV), metapneumovirus (MPV), endemic seasonal coronaviruses (sCoV), and rhinovirus (RV) had distinct seasonal circulating patterns albeit with variations globally by geographical and environmental characteristics [2] , [3] , [4] . In 2020, the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the large-scale implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) across the globe was associated with a precipitous and major impact on the circulation of common respiratory viruses; the activity of IV and RSV remained remarkably lower during the usual circulating season in multiple countries [5] , [6] , [7] . The subsequent relaxation of NPIs resulted in an unprecedented out-of-season resurgence of RSV in several countries, likely a result of depleted population immunity [8] . However, the resurgence of these common respiratory viruses did not occur simultaneously. For example, according to the weekly sentinel surveillance report from New South Wales, Australia, in January 2022, while all respiratory viruses included in the report had substantially lower activity than the 2015–2019 average level in 2020, RV and adenovirus (AdV) appeared to be the least affected; RSV activity was suppressed until an out-of-season resurgence occurred in September 2020; by contrast, there had been limited activity of PIV and MPV until mid-2021, and circulation of IV remained at very low level by the end of 2021 [9] . Interestingly, similar asynchronous resurgence was also noted in other countries with varied timing and stridency of NPIs [10] , [11] . It remains unclear whether the observed variations in the resurgence of these respiratory viruses are regionally specific or globally consistent, which can be crucial for enhancing future pandemic preparedness and informing public health strategies. In this study, we compiled a large dataset on respiratory virus activity across the globe from published studies, surveillance reports, and international collaborators. We determined the onset and peak of epidemics from different data sources using a unified method. We used a generalised linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) framework to synthesise the time interval between epidemic onsets and between epidemic peaks of different respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic. (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1: Overview of methodology. Data were collected from three sources: systematic literature review, online surveillance reports, and the RSV GEN network. The epidemic onset was defined using a “4-week trend” method, where each week’s viral activity (case numbers or positive proportion) was compared to that of four weeks prior. An epidemic onset was identified when four consecutive weeks showed higher activity than their respective weeks four weeks earlier (“up-weeks”). Two approaches were implemented: (1) A descriptive pooling approach that compared intervals between consecutive epidemic onsets of the same virus across sites for both pre- and post-pandemic periods; (2) An analytical matching approach that examined the relative timing differences between pairs of viruses’ resurgence, matched by study site.
