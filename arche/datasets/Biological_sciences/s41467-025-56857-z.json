    "content": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a common and complex autoimmune disease, caused by an interplay of many unknown genes and environmental factors. Yet, it has been difficult to precisely pinpoint and functionally confirm the causative factors. Thanks to genome-wide association studies (GWAS), hundreds of lupus disease-associated loci in the genome have been identified, which has strengthened the view that SLE is indeed a polygenic disease most likely regulated by variants in loci determining tolerance and immune responsiveness of the immune system [1] . However, the identification of the causative SNPs and the inducing environmental factors, remains largely unknown [2] , [3] . An alternative approach to identify the underlying genes has been to use genetic crosses of inbred animals susceptible to SLE. We have approached this problem by positioning the causative genes in mice and rats, and with these studies, we could identify some of the most important SNPs for complex autoimmune diseases. The first autoimmune disease-associated gene cloned was the neutrophil cytosolic factor ( Ncf1 ), encoding a protein (NCF1, alias p47phox) critically involved in the formation of the NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) complex, responsible for inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) responses [4] , [5] . In rats, an amino acid replacing SNP ( Ncf1 T153M ) associated with autoimmune diseases was positioned [4] , [6] , and an effect was reproduced in mice with a spontaneous Ncf1 m1J mutation [7] . In humans, the NCF1 locus has been difficult to study due to copy number variations (CNV), but after exon sequencing a functionally important SNP could be identified [8] . This SNP (rs201802880 or NCF1-339 , here denoted NCF1 R90H ) replaces arginine with histidine at position 90 (R90H), affecting NCF1 interaction with the plasma cell membrane [5] . Analysis of SLE cohorts showed a high odds ratio (OR) and allelic frequency for NCF1-339 (NCF1 90H ) [9] , [10] . Importantly, the NCF1 90H allele caused a decreased ROS response in phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated cells from patients with SLE in vitro, and it was also associated with an activated interferon signaling response, similar to previous findings in the Ncf1 m1J mutated mice [10] , [11] , [12] . BALB/c mice with the Ncf1 m1J mutation spontaneously showed signs of lupus with autoantibodies and glomerulonephritis and developed severe pristane-induced lupus, a commonly used mouse model of SLE [12] , [13] . The Ncf1 m1J mutation was associated with the activation of interferon signaling genes, including the STAT1 pathway [12] . An important remaining question is why and how the interferon response, and the development of lupus, are triggered in the presence of a low ROS-producing NCF1 variant. The detected antibodies to murine norovirus (MNV) in ROS-deficient Ncf1 m1J mutated mice with spontaneous lupus preliminarily suggested norovirus as a possible environmental factor [12] . In humans, there is no consensus on specific causative environmental challenges or virus infections, although DNA viruses, such as Epstein Barr virus (EBV), BK-virus (BKV), and retroviruses (RV) have been suggested to have disease association [14] , [15] , [16] . No substantial evidence for triggering lupus as a result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic has been observed, although scattered cases have been reported. However, Covid-19 has been shown to be able to trigger the presentation or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases as well as a longstanding inflammatory syndrome in genetically predisposed patients [17] , [18] , [19] . Genetic predisposition accounts for approximately thirty percent of the risk of developing autoimmune diseases and interacting environmental factors could include toxic agents and diet but also infections [20] . The NCF1-regulated differences in the interferon signaling responses were seen in germ-free mice only after immunization, and they were also obvious after pristane injection, which triggered a more severe lupus-associated response [12] , [13] , [21] . Like several other mouse lupus models, pristane-induced lupus has been extensively studied for pathogenic mechanisms, and different downstream causative mechanisms have been suggested [22] . To understand the pathogenic role of the NCF1 polymorphism relevant to humans, we have addressed the role of the Ncf1 R90H alleles in mice. Here we study the Ncf1 R90H alleles in mice, to understand the pathogenic role of the NCF1 polymorphism relevant to humans. To our surprise, the Ncf1 90H allele does not enhance pristane-induced lupus in the mice under specific pathogen-free conditions. However, infection with MNV causes the development of severe lupus in Ncf1 90H mice irrespective of whether these were naïve or injected with pristane. Thus, a synergy between a defined gene mutation and a specific non-autologous factor for the induction of an autoimmune disease is described.",
