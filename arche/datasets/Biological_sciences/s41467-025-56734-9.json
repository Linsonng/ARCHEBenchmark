    "content": "The initial prime editing (PE) system was constructed by fusing a Strep. pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9) nickase (H840A) with an engineered Moloney-Murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (M-MLV RT) [1] . To enable editing, a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) is used, which includes a protospacer defining the target site, a sgRNA scaffold, and a 3′ extension encoding the desired edit. This extension contains a primer binding site (PBS) complementary to a segment of the DNA protospacer, as well as an RT template (RTT) that encodes the desired edit and genomic homologous sequences [1] . PEs hold great promise in modern biotechnology. However, all existing PEs can only modify the downstream genomic region of the pegRNA nick, but cannot modify the upstream genomic region, posing a significant limitation on their editing range. In addition, the editing efficiency of PEs remains to be improved. There have been efforts to expand the editing range of PE. In one study, substituting SpyCas9 nickase (H840A) with Francisella novicida Cas9 nickase (H969A) expands the editing range of PE [2] . The circular RNA-mediated prime editor (CPE) which combines Cas12a with circular RNA [3] , and template-jumping prime editing (TJ-PE) [4] , inspired by the genomic insertion mechanism of retrotransposons, also expand the editing range. The performance of PE has also been enhanced through other strategies. For example, adding motifs, such as modified prequeosine 1 -1 riboswitch aptamer (evopreQ1) [5] , Csy4 [6] , G-quadruplexes [7] , viral exoribonuclease-resistant RNA motif (xrRNA) [8] , or MS2 [9] , to the 3′ extension of the pegRNA improves the stability of the pegRNA and consequently the PE efficiency. Protein engineering to PE system, such as altering the composition of nuclear localization signals [10] , introducing point mutations to alter certain amino acid residue [11] or adding additional peptide or protein domains (e.g., IGFpm1-NFATC2IPp1-PE2 (IN-PE2) [12] , chromatin-modulating peptide-PE-Variant1 (CMP-PE-V1) [13] , hyPE2 [14] , PE combined with the recruitment of P65 protein [15] ), as well as adding the dominant negative MLH1 (MLH1dn) mutant to inhibit the mismatch repair pathway, is also effective in improving PE efficiency [11] . Nevertheless, while many PE systems could achieve double-digit (i.e., >10%) efficiencies in human cells, they can only do so within approximately a 10 bp range downstream of the nick [1] , [11] . Hence there is a need for further expanding the editable region of PE systems, particularly for editing sites located more than 10 bp away downstream from the nick, and editing sites located upstream from the nick. Recently, the use of two-pegRNA, such as in dual-pegRNA [16] , twinPE [17] , GRAND (genome editing by RTTs partially aligned to each other but nonhomologous to target sequences within duo pegRNA) [18] , PRIME-Del [19] , homologous 3′ extension mediated prime editor (HOPE) [20] , and bi-direction prime editing (Bi-PE) [21] , has gained momentum in expanding the editing range of PE and improving its efficiency. It should be noted however, that in these two-pegRNA systems the two nicks are located on the complementary strands, i.e., in trans , which is associated with an elevated probability of inducing double-strand breaks (DSBs) [22] , [23] . Furthermore, the editable region is positioned in between the downstream direction of these two-pegRNA nicks. In other words, these two-pegRNA approaches are still unable to edit the upstream region of either pegRNA nick. Here, we report the development of the EXPERT. EXPERT uses an additional sgRNA (ups-sgRNA) that is located upstream of pegRNA to generate a cis nick of the pegRNA nick, and an extended pegRNA (ext-pegRNA) that has an elongated and modified 3′ extension. We compared EXPERT with the representative single-pegRNA system PE2 and the two-pegRNA system twinPE, demonstrating that EXPERT achieves higher product purity. The results reveal that EXPERT can efficiently perform editing on both sides of the ext-pegRNA nick, a task that is unattainable by canonical PEs, while maintaining low indel rates at the target site and minimal off-target effects genome-wide. Additionally, the EXPERT strategy proves particularly useful for large fragment edits. Collectively, EXPERT represents an effective gene-editing tool that complements the PE toolbox and holds significant value in life sciences.",
