    "content": "Cytometric analysis has gained tremendous attention in immunological experiments, as a method that produces reliable, high-throughput measurements of single cells. Flow cytometry, introduced in the 1960s to separate and count immune cell subtypes, underwent a critical evolution with increased speed and parameters [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] . Mass cytometry, also known as cytometry by time-of-flight, was developed in 2009 to include more parameters in the analysis and avoid the difficulty of fluorescence compensation [5] , [6] , [7] . Flow cytometry labels the antibodies with fluorophores, whose emission spectra overlap to some extent, causing spillover of signal between channels. In contrast, mass cytometry tags antibodies with heavy metal ions, whose discrete atomic masses can be distinguished by mass spectrometry very precisely and with minimal spillover. Although flow cytometry and mass cytometry aim for similar functionality with labeled antibodies, they do not have similar strategies to detect cell aggregates [8] . The most important and widely used method of subtyping cell populations is referred to as gating, which is usually a boundary or polygon defined on a bivariate density map of the entire cell population (2D density map represented by two selected protein measurements). Gating for different cell types is usually configured hierarchically [9] , to mimic the biological hierarchy of immune cell differentiation. Even though mass cytometry and flow cytometry rely on different technologies, they both employ similar gating procedures for cell type identification. However, manually defining boundaries for each cell subtype and each sample can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Thus, algorithms have been developed that attempt to automate this task, including unsupervised clustering to identify cell subtypes [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , supervised deep learning methods [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , as well as some density-based gating methods [18] , [19] . Although unsupervised methods can target certain cell subpopulations effectively, their results often contain some remaining cell clusters that are unrecognizable and/or sometimes can fail to capture rare cell types making interpretation challenging [20] . Such methods usually lack the ability to reproduce cytometric gating from human experts, and it is hard for those methods to adapt to existing domain knowledge to satisfactorily explain the clustering results. A typical manual analysis pipeline of this data first separates live, viable single cells from unwanted events, then gates these into different cell populations. A major challenge is that methods, like those described above, typically assume that single cells have been separated from doublets, debris, and other unwanted events, a process that we call “pre-gating”. Efficient open-source methods employing pre-gating using adaptive approaches to define populations and account for variability in signal intensity between samples, however, do not exist. Indeed, current unsupervised clustering methods typically require manual “pre-gating” before applying unsupervised analysis. While manual pre-gating still requires much human labor to annotate and draw polygons for the region of interest, existing bivariate pipelines also need human input to pre-define the relevant parameters. For example, those parameters include where the actual population is located as well as the approximate percentage of the target cell population. Currently, no software can configure a series of bivariate pre-gating (and gating) tasks where gates are set in a hierarchical order. Our goal is to automate the analysis process. The application of deep learning has been effective in disentangling complex relationships in different cytometric domains including cell type identification and cell sorting in cytometric time series data [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] . Most of the existing methods focus on providing a global classification of different cell types in one step by using a multi-channel dense neural network. Moreover, these methods also usually assume pre-gated data as input, and they have not been validated for complex pre-gating tasks. In particular, one of the major challenges in performing automatic pre-gating is the technical and biological variance across different subjects. Even if the experimental protocol and the panel of measured proteins are held constant, differences in sample preparation and even instrument variation, can cause fluctuations in protein detection and precise population “shape” in the data. In addition, only predicting terminal cell types (such as naïve T cells) will prevent accurate gating of the intermediate cell types (such as T cells or lymphocytes). In the bivariate setting from manual gating, gates are configured in a tree-like structure, and at each level, the parent cell population is split into smaller subpopulations so that gating results for all intermediate cell types are obtained. The hierarchy structure guarantees the interpretability of the target cell populations. It also clearly defines some cells that are not included in the subsequent gating but still belong to the current gating step (out-of-boundary cells that are not included in any subsequent cell types). The same strategy used for manual pre-gating can be easily extended to downstream automatic gating of immune cell types, since cell-type gates have a more stable and fixed bivariate boundary compared to pre-gates. Therefore, we combined those two types of tasks and refer to all of them, onward, as “gating”. While existing methods are suboptimal to accommodate biological variance within the protein expression data, deep neural networks with convolutional kernels have the ability to address such data challenges, using the properties of translational invariance and equivariance [21] , [22] . The convolutional architecture was originally designed for image classification tasks. It can detect target objects regardless of their positions in the image space and learn the general features of each target object. This versatility led to their adaptation for image segmentation tasks. The reason manual gating is challenging for automated software is that human experts have a global view of the cell density in certain protein measurement spaces so that they can visually inspect and quantify the desired cell type. Therefore, to address this challenge together with the biological and technical variance, we propose and validate UNITO, a method employing image segmentation for automated gating. UNITO converts the cytometrically derived protein expression into an image of bivariate density to enable a global identification of the cell population. Furthermore, with the ability to perform pixel-level prediction, UNITO intuitively defines the region of interest on the bivariate density maps for cytometric gating. By validating UNITO on three independent study cohorts and two cytometric modalities, we hypothesize that the framework can learn any pre-gating and gating tasks from human annotation, and then adaptively draw contours and assign labels to cells from independent data. This ability to perform inference on unseen samples without human supervision will enable applications to large-scale immunology studies.",
