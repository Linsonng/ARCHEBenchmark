    "content": "GTPases are essential regulatory proteins that are highly conserved across species. They play crucial roles in regulating various biological processes, including signal transduction, intercellular transport, protein synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, and so on [1] , [2] , [3] . Based on the phylogenetic and structural analyses, GTPases can be divided into two large superclasses: SIMIBI (Signal Recognition GTPases and the MinD and BioD) superclass and TRAFAC (Translation Factor) superclass [1] . OLA1 and its bacteria homolog YchF belong to the TRAFAC class, Obg (spo0B-associated GTP-binding protein) family, and YchF subfamily of P-loop GTPases [4] , [5] . The OLA1/YchF proteins possess a core ATPase domain, a C-terminal TGS domain, and an inserted helical domain (Supplementary Fig. 1 ) and are ubiquitously expressed in a majority of organisms, including bacteria, plants, and humans, sharing more than 40% sequence identity (Supplementary Fig. 2 ) [6] . The G4 motif ((N/T)KxD) in the YchF subfamily exhibits a unique (N/T)(M/L/V)xE amino acid sequence, leading to the members losing GTP specificity and preferentially hydrolyzing ATP rather than GTP [5] , [7] . OLA1/YchF is involved in various cellular stress response pathways, such as heat shock, integrated stress, cell adhesion, and antioxidant responses [8] , [9] . It is also implicated in the regulation of tumor progression in numerous types of cancer, including breast, lung, and hepatocellular cancer [10] , [11] , [12] . Accumulating reports show that OLA1 is highly expressed in most cancers and could be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer [10] , [13] , [14] , [15] . OLA1 also works as an intrinsic stress response regulator, including oxidative stress [6] and heat shock [16] , [17] . Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is a key molecule in different types of cancer, and high expression of HSP70 is associated with poor tumor progression [18] . OLA1 regulates HSP70 protein stability to inhibit shock-induced cell death [16] . OLA1 also interacts with BRCA1 and BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1, which affects centrosome function and is suspected to lead to carcinogenesis in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer [11] , [19] , [20] . Growing evidence shows that OLA1/YchF plays important roles in translation regulation on a subset of mRNAs, such as leaderless mRNAs encoding stress response proteins essential for cell survival [21] . Human OLA1 has been implicated in translation initiation by interacting with eIF2, thereby preventing its binding to the initiator methionyl-tRNA [22] . Conversely, under stress conditions, the down-regulation of OLA1 enhances translation initiation and mitigate the integrated stress response (ISR) [22] , [23] . A recent study in Mollicutes found that YchF is one of the 104 core set proteins that sustain ribosome biogenesis and the translation of the genetic code in self-replicating bacteria with reduced genomes [24] . Ribosome binding of OLA1/YchF has been observed in E.coli [21] , [25] , [26] , [27] , yeast [17] , Trypanosoma [4] , plants [7] , and human cells [22] . The available data suggest that YchF/OLA1 binds not only to fully assembled ribosomes but also independently to the small and large ribosomal subunits. Moreover, the 70S ribosome has been reported to stimulate the ATPase activity of YchF [26] . Recent biochemical studies using UV-inducible crosslinkers locate YchF at the E-site on the 30S small ribosomal subunit [21] . Despite these advances, questions remain unanswered regarding the molecular details of ribosome binding and translation regulation, as well as the exact roles of OLA1/YchF during these processes. One major reason for this gap is the lack of structural data capturing OLA1/YchF in complex with ribosomes. Here, we report that OLA1/YchF binds to the ribosomal large subunit and promotes efficient translation on D/E-rich mRNA. Disruption in translation can be caused by truncated mRNA or mRNA with specific structures/sequences [28] . Rescuing stalled ribosomes on these mRNAs requires numerous ribosome-associated proteins to release the nascent peptide and split the ribosome. For instance, the proteins Dom34, Hbs1 and Rli1 target ribosomes with truncated mRNA in eukaryotes, catalyzing the splitting of subunit [28] . Stalls on specific mRNA structures/sequences can be resolved under optimal conditions, i.e., synthesis of P-rich is made possible by EF-P (in bacteria, eIF5A in eukaryotes and archaea) [29] . Stalling on R/K-rich mRNA is promoted by Rbg1/Tma46 complex or targeted/split by the RQT complex if ribosome collision occurs [30] , [31] . The bacteria ATP-Binding Cassette family-F (ABCF) proteins, YheS, YbiT/YkpA, EttA and Uup/YfmR could cope with these problematic nascent peptide sequences within the exit tunnel [32] , [33] . The ATP hydrolysis-coupled structural rearrangement is critical for handling ribosome stalling caused by nascent peptides [32] . Currently, there is limited research on D/E-rich mRNA. Through structural analysis and Ribo-seq data, we speculate that OLA1/YchF enhances translation on D/E-rich mRNA, a notion validated by our constructed reporter. OLA1/YchF binds to the large subunit at the uL14/bL19 position via its helical domain, preventing the re-association of split ribosomes. These findings not only provide deeper insights into OLA1/YchF function but also contribute to a better understanding of translation regulation on D/E-rich mRNA.",
