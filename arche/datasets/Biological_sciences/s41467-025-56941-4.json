    "content": "Collective cell migration is a hallmark of morphogenesis, tissue homeostasis, and wound healing [1] , [2] , [3] . A central element that determines whether cells migrate collectively or individually is the strength of intercellular adhesions [4] . Cell-cell adhesions mediated by classical cadherins link neighboring cells through interactions between their extracellular domains, while α-catenin and β-catenin recruit to the cytoplasmic tail, forming a mechanosensitive link to the actin cytoskeleton [5] , [6] . Hence, cadherins both mechanically connect cells as structural elements and activate intercellular signaling circuits that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and gene expression [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] . In contrast to signaling circuits emanating from protein complexes that link the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells, the contribution of signaling cues originating directly from the plasma membrane in collective cell dynamics has been largely overlooked. The membrane is often regarded as a passive structure whose primary role is to separate the cell’s exterior from its interior, thereby enabling signal transduction via transmembrane protein complexes. However, recent studies challenge this view. In single cells, changes in membrane properties have been shown to significantly influence leading edge dynamics [13] , [14] , [15] and migration behavior [16] , [17] , [18] . Notably, these alterations in membrane properties are accomplished not only by direct mechano-chemical feedback loops, but also by intracellular signaling and changes in gene expression [19] , [20] . Consequently, changes at the plasma membrane not only yield short-term changes in cell, but also have long-term effects [21] , [22] . Collectively, these studies suggest that protein-independent signaling cascades that originate from within the plasma membrane are suitable for initiating sustained changes in cell dynamics. Despite this, although it is evident that membrane mechanics regulate the dynamics of individual cells, the contribution of plasma membrane-derived signals to collective cell migration—independent of the direct link between adhesions and cytoskeleton and the associated biochemical signaling cascades—remains unclear. A significant challenge in addressing this question is the lack of tools capable of dissecting the mechanical cues at the plasma membrane from the mechano-transduction through cell-cell adhesion molecules to the cytoskeleton and biochemical signals. For example, the truncation of the cytoplasmic catenin-binding domains renders E-cadherin nonfunctional, as the membrane-anchored extracellular domain alone is insufficient to sustain intercellular cell-cell adhesions [23] , [24] . Here, we set out to explore the relevance of membrane-based signaling for collective cell dynamics. To selectively elicit signals that originate from within the plasma membrane, we used artificial photoswitchable cell-cell adhesions based on the cyanobacterial phytochrome 1 (Cph1), which induce cell-cell adhesions on red light illumination without directly linking to the actin cytoskeleton [25] . We found that an increase in cell-cell connections leads to coordinated and collective cell movement in cells that otherwise would migrate as single cells. Increased cell-cell adhesions did not slow cells down, as would be expected when augmenting friction [26] , but made them faster. At the cellular level, the photoactivated increase in cell-cell adhesions resulted in an increase in membrane tension. Notably, it also activated the enzyme phospholipase D2 (PLD2), resulting in an increase in phosphatidic acid (PA) and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. These findings demonstrate that mechanical coupling of cells at their membranes via artificial adhesion proteins that do not link directly to the actin cytoskeleton induces increased membrane tension, which is sufficient to achieve collective cell migration.",
