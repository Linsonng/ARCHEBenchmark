    "content": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is the most common cause of dementia, affecting more than 6 million Americans [1] . AD pathology initiates decades before the onset of gross behavioral symptoms and is primarily defined by the aggregation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in extracellular plaques and of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins as intracellular neurofibrillary tangles [2] , [3] , [4] . In addition to Aβ and tau, other coexisting molecular changes [4] , [5] , such as α-synuclein [6] , [7] , TDP-43 [5] , [8] , and U1 snRNP [9] , [10] , may play important roles in disease progression. Genetic analyses of AD and control cases have elucidated three causative genes ( APP , PSEN1 , and PSEN2 ), high-risk genes ( APOE4 and TREM2 ) and about 100 low-risk genes and loci [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] . However, the molecular mechanisms of these proteins/genes in AD development are not fully understood, often due to the lack of suitable cellular or animal models. More than 100 genetic AD mouse models have been developed [21] , [22] , [23] , [24] , predominantly by mimicking genetic mutations linked to familial AD, such as the lines of 5xFAD [25] , [26] , 3xTG [27] , and APP-KI including APP NLF (NLF) and APP NLGF (NLGF) [28] . However, none of these models capture the full spectrum of AD molecular events and pathologies as they exhibit less severe neurodegeneration compared to human patients. Ideally, researchers should fully understand the advantages and limitations of mouse models to select the most appropriate one for addressing specific hypotheses; however, no comprehensive resources are currently available. Rapid developments in omics technologies provide an opportunity of thoroughly evaluating disease models on a global scale and exploring their relevance by comparisons with human data [29] , [30] , [31] . Transcriptomic analyses of the amyloidosis mouse models revealed changes in expression of genes linked to immune response, synaptic function, and neuronal signaling [32] , [33] , [34] . However, RNA levels do not always align with protein levels due to posttranscriptional processes, such as translation and protein turnover [35] . Indeed, notable inconsistencies between transcript and protein levels in AD and 5xFAD mice were observed [36] , [37] . Complementary proteomic studies in AD mice [38] , [39] , [40] , [41] not only corroborated transcriptomic findings, but also identified RNA-independent protein alterations [36] , [39] , [42] and changes in protein turnover [43] , [44] . These early proteomic studies in the AD mice uncovered some molecular changes but they were often limited by inadequate proteomic depth, restricted analysis of individual mouse models, and/or insufficient comparison with human AD datasets. Here we present a deep, age-dependent analysis of 10,369 proteins (10,331 genes) and 12,096 phosphopeptides (10,532 phosphosites) across commonly used AD models: 5xFAD [25] , NLF [28] , and NLGF [28] . We also profiled two additional AD models (3xTG [27] and BiG [45] ), performed human-mouse comparisons, and analyzed transcriptome-proteome inconsistency in both mouse and human. To explore the contribution of protein degradation to the transcriptome-proteome inconsistency, we measured the turnover rates of 8492 brain proteins and found that amyloid formation delays the degradation of amyloidome components. Thus, our comprehensive proteomic analysis identifies shared AD pathways and demonstrates altered protein turnover in amyloid plaques in AD mice. All data are freely available and searchable through an interactive website.",
