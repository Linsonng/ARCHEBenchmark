    "content": "Loneliness is often described as a global epidemic [1] , [2] , [3] that is linked to negative outcomes that span the gamut from depression to cardiovascular disease to premature death [4] , [5] . These stark realities compelled the World Health Organization to declare loneliness a major health concern in 2019 [6] , [7] and the U.S. to release a Surgeon General’s Advisory in 2023 [8] . In response, media articles and public health campaigns have proliferated with warnings about the dangers of being alone [9] , [10] . For example, the United States’ Commit to Connect campaign’s priority is to “increase awareness about the harms of social isolation and loneliness across all segments of society” [2] . Likewise, a report by the United Kingdom’s Campaign to End Loneliness notes that “isolation can be as harmful to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day and is more damaging than obesity” [11] . Here we suggest that this discourse, though well-intentioned, may paradoxically contribute to the problem of loneliness by influencing a potential driver of this state: people’s beliefs about being alone. This argument is grounded in the observation that being alone is not inherently harmful. Although experiences of being alone and loneliness are often conflated [12] , they are distinct states [13] , [14] , [15] . Some people are content spending time alone [13] , [16] , [17] , whereas others interact with people frequently and still feel lonely [14] . Indeed, a study of over 11,000 participants revealed that the strength of the relationship between being alone and feeling alone (i.e., loneliness) was weak ( r = 0.20) [18] . More recent studies demonstrate similarly modest associations ( r range: 0.13 to 0.25 across studies) [19] , [20] , [21] . Although loneliness is a negative state that people generally try to avoid [22] , time alone can be a desirable part of daily life [16] , [23] . Consider that American adults spend ~30–65% of their waking hours alone [20] , [24] and often intentionally seek out such experiences [17] , [25] . According to one recent estimate, for example, 85% of the time that people spend by themselves is deliberately chosen [26] . Being alone can of course induce loneliness [27] , [28] . Yet, a less frequently heralded literature indicates that spending time alone can also promote well-being [13] , [16] , emotion regulation [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] , and cognitive restoration [33] . Conversely, spending less time alone than one would like is associated with increased stress and depression [34] . Thus, there is substantial variability in people’s experiences of being alone [23] . One factor that may consequentially influence the emotional impact of being alone is how people think about this experience. Decades of research indicate that people’s beliefs powerfully impact their emotional responses to a vast array of situations [35] , [36] by systematically recruiting prefrontal and parietal networks that modulate affective reactions [37] , [38] . The wide-ranging nature of these effects is well documented. For example, interventions that target beliefs positively impact experiences that range from stress [39] and depression [40] to weight loss [41] and sleep [42] . Drawing from this work, we reasoned that people’s beliefs about being alone should influence their experiences of time alone. Preliminary evidence supporting this idea comes from two laboratory experiments which found that teaching people about the benefits of being alone increased how positive they felt after spending 10 min by themselves [30] , [31] . Yet, whether these findings extend beyond a brief laboratory task is unclear. Here, we provide evidence across five multi-method studies that people’s beliefs about being alone, which are shaped by media discourse on this issue, influence experiences of loneliness in daily life. In Study 1, we find that contemporary U.S. news articles frequently portray being alone as harmful. Study 2 demonstrates that brief exposure to such portrayals causally influences people’s beliefs about being alone. Study 3, a 2-week experience-sampling study, shows that people who hold negative beliefs about being alone experience a significant increase in loneliness after spending time alone in daily life, whereas those with positive beliefs experience a significant decrease in loneliness after spending the same amount of time alone. Finally, Studies 4 and 5 demonstrate the generalizability of these findings across nine countries spanning six continents. Together, these results reveal beliefs about being alone as a notable driver of loneliness, offering new directions for interventions aimed at reducing this widespread problem.",
