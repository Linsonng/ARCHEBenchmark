    "content": "Pathogens and their hosts employ various strategies to gain the upper hand in the tug-of-war [1] , [2] , [3] . Due to the miniature size of most pathogens, their life cycle is strongly affected by environmental factors including temperature and humidity, whose levels oscillate on a daily basis [4] . Consequently, increased success of pathogen colonization happens at a specific time of a day when the environmental conditions are more favourable [5] , [6] . Ingeniously, plants couple their immune system with the circadian clock, an endogenous timing system that enables plants to anticipate and prepare for such time-of-day infections [7] . Given the prevalence and importance of this circadian-mediated defence, it is conceivable that pathogens may interfere with plant circadian clock. Indeed, previous studies have shown that pathogen infection can alter the expression pattern of plant circadian clock genes [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] . However, how phytopathogens trigger these perturbations and the specific clock components targeted by pathogens remain elusive. The downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis ( Hpa ) belongs to oomycetes which also include notorious plant pathogens such as the soybean pathogen Phytophthora sojae and the potato late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans which caused the Irish Great Famine. As an obligate biotroph, Hpa can only grow on living plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana [13] . The availability of genome sequences of both Hpa and Arabidopsis has led to the widespread use of the Hpa - Arabidopsis pathosystem for studying the co-evolution of the host and parasite [14] . And the circadian-mediated plant defence response was first reported in the studies of the interaction between Hpa and Arabidopsis [8] . To counteract plant defences, Hpa secretes apoplastic effectors to the plant extracellular space or cytoplastic effectors into the plant cells. A subset of the cytoplastic effectors is characterized by a highly conserved region known as the RXLR motif (which stands for arginine, any amino acid, leucine, arginine). These RXLR-type effectors typically contain an N-terminal signal peptide for secretion from the pathogen, a RXLR motif flanked by a high frequency of acidic (D/E) residues for targeting the host cell, and a C-terminal effector domain that determines their activity [15] . Bioinformatic analysis has predicted more than 130 RXLR-type effectors from Hpa [16] , but the functions of most of these effectors have not been characterized. In this study, we first conducted a yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) screen testing potential interaction between 50 predicted Hpa effectors which have been previously reported to be highly expressed during Hpa infection [17] and 11 Arabidopsis central clock components. We found that the effector named HaRxL10 interacted with several clock components including CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE, also known as TCP21, AT5G08330) in yeast (Supplementary Fig. 1 ), implying that HaRxL10 may affect plant circadian clock in a CHE-dependent manner. CHE belongs to TCP (TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF) family transcription factors and recognises the TCP-binding site (TBS) cis-element in the gene promoters. CHE is a well-known central clock component, directly repressing the expression of the morning gene CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 ( CCA1 , AT2G46830) [18] . CHE also interacts with other clock components, such as the evening-phased transcription factor TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1, AT5G61380) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase ZETLUPE (ZTL, AT5G57360) [18] , [19] . CHE plays a crucial role in salicylic acid (SA)-mediated plant immunity [20] , [21] . Our subsequent molecular and genetic data showed that HaRxL10 interacted with CHE to interfere with ZTL-mediated CHE degradation. While HaRxL10 stabilised CHE, it repressed CHE’s binding to its downstream regulatory genes. HaRxL10 triggered a significant reprogramming of the transcriptome, particularly affecting the expression of several central clock genes, such as CHE , CCA1 , TCP22 and TOC1 . Additionally, HaRxL10 acted as a virulent effector to repress SA-mediated plant immunity and had a notable impact on leaf movement, maltose levels, hypocotyl growth and flowering time in a CHE-dependent manner. Overall, HaRxL10 perturbed the key clock component CHE’s transcriptional regulation function as well as several physiological processes.",
