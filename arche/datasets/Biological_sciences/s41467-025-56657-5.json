    "content": "C andida albicans ( C. albicans ), an opportunistic yeast, is a member of the human mycobiota in the oral, gastrointestinal, and vaginal mucosa. In patients with ulcerative colitis, high-damaging C. albicans strains form hyphae and exacerbate intestinal inflammation [1] . In immunocompromised and critically ill patients, C. albicans transitions from a commensal organism in the gut to an opportunistic pathogen that causes disseminated candidiasis, which is a leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections. In developed countries, this leads to a mortality rate that can exceed 40%, even in patients given antifungal treatment [2] . Hyphal morphogenesis controls the balance between gut commensalism and invasive infection [3] , [4] , [5] . C. albicans invades host tissues through a process associated with yeast-to-hyphal transition [6] , [7] . Hyphae induce a higher level of IL-1β secretion than the yeast form [8] , [9] . The presence of gut C. albicans strains with a high ability to induce IL-1β production in phagocytes is positively correlated with increased disease severity in their host with ulcerative colitis [1] . C. albicans candidalysin, a hypha-secreted pore-forming toxin, damages epithelial cells and fuels proinflammatory immunity in the mucosa and gut [1] , [10] . Als proteins, well-known as adhesins and invasins [11] , not only induce intestinal adaptive immune responses but also exacerbate intestinal colitis and colon damage [12] . Among Als family proteins, Als3 is the most abundant and hypha-specific protein. It induces immune responses that promote fungal clearance during systemic infection [9] . Death effector domains (DEDs), protein-protein interaction domains identified in proteins such as Fas-associated death domain (FADD), caspase-8, and cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (cFLIP), regulate inflammation and cell death including apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis [13] , [14] , [15] . FADD initiates caspase-8 oligomerization via DED-DED interactions, forming a FADD/caspase-8 complex that regulates cell death pathways [16] , [17] . Genetic ablation of either Caspase-8 or Fadd in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) results in necroptosis and caspase-8-gasdermin-D-mediated pyroptosis-like death, leading to spontaneous ileitis and/or colitis [18] , [19] , [20] . Expression of catalytically inactive caspase-8 C362A or C262S triggers the formation of caspase-8/ASC specks, activation of caspase-1, and secretion of IL-1β [14] , [15] . Intracellular pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoa, must replicate without killing the host cell to survive. Therefore, their interactions with the host intracellular components have been widely studied. The cellular FLICE (caspase-8)-like inhibitory protein (short form, cFLIPs) and viral FLIPs (vFLIPs) function as apoptosis inhibitors and consist of two tandem DEDs similar to the prodomain of caspase-8 [21] , [22] . vFLIPs inhibit death ligand-induced apoptosis by interacting with FADD and/or caspase-8 via DED-DED interaction [21] . C. albicans DNA packaged in extracellular vesicles triggers type I IFN signaling through the intracellular cGAS-STING pathway [23] . As an extracellular organism, C. albicans proteins have not been reported to directly influence intracellular cell death core components at the molecular level. Here, we show that hyphal Als3 interacts with the DEDs of FADD and caspase-8 to modulate immune responses and cell death pathways. Als3 is a DED-interacting protein that does not have a DED but functionally resembles DED-containing proteins like vFLIPs. Although there is increasing interest in studying the recognition of fungal extracellular proteins/peptides [24] , [25] , this intracellular recognition mechanism extends our understanding of innate immune recognition.",
