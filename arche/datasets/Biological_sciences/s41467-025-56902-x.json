    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated antiviral and vaccine development [1] . Drug repurposing was the primary strategy early in the pandemic, but genuinely new strategies have also emerged [2] , [3] . One of the ultimate goals is to develop broad-spectrum oral antivirals that can be used to prevent and treat pathogens with pandemic potential [4] . Priorities have been given to conserved viral targets, including polymerases and proteases. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors remdesivir and molnupiravir are known to have broad-spectrum antiviral activities against viruses in different families. For example, remdesivir, developed initially against the hepatitis C virus, has well-documented antiviral efficacy against filoviruses (e.g., Ebola, Marburg), coronaviruses (e.g., MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2), Pneumoviridae (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus), and paramyxoviruses (e.g., Nipah, Hendra, measles, and mumps) [5] , [6] . Molnupiravir is effective against influenza viruses and coronaviruses [7] . Similarly, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) inhibitor nirmatrelvir has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and common human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1 [8] , [9] . Additional antivirals with alternative mechanisms of action are needed to combat viruses for which no antivirals are available or for which drug resistance issues with current antivirals are associated. Structurally disparate compounds have been developed as SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors through high-throughput screening (HTS), fragment-based and structure-based design [1] , [10] . Paxlovid, a combination of the M pro inhibitor nirmatrelvir and metabolic enhancer ritonavir, is approved by the FDA [9] . Ensitrelvir is a noncovalent M pro inhibitor approved in Japan and Singapore [11] . Several additional M pro inhibitors are at different stages of clinical trials, including Pfizer’s second-generation inhibitor PF-07817883 (Ibuzatrelvir) [12] and Merck’s MK-7845 [13] . Mutations have emerged in M pro among circulating strains [14] , including the predominant mutation P132H [15] . Fortunately, the P132H mutant remains sensitive to nirmatrelvir [15] , and drug-resistant variants have yet to become prevalent in the clinic. Nevertheless, nirmatrelvir-resistant mutants have been identified from in vitro viral passage and enzymatic assay experiments [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] . The M pro L50F/E166A/L167F triple mutant is of particular concern as the corresponding recombinant virus showed a high level of drug resistance while maintaining similar fitness of replication in cell culture and animals [19] , [20] . The Nsp5-L50F/E166V mutant was found in an immunocompromised human patient who underwent prolonged Paxlovid treatment [21] . The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL pro ) is the second cysteine protease expressed by SARS-CoV-2 in addition to M pro during viral replication. PL pro is part of the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) and cleaves viral polyproteins at the nsp1/2, nsp2/3, and nsp3/4 junctions [22] . PL pro also has deubiquitinase and deISGylase activities and cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 conjugates from host proteins, a mechanism to antagonize host immune responses [23] , [24] . Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the interest in developing PL pro inhibitors has resurged, and several PL pro inhibitors have been identified from HTS, drug repurposing, and virtual screening [25] . PL pro is a cysteine protease with shallow S1 and S2 substrate binding sites (corresponds to Gly-Gly in substrates) [22] , which accounts for the challenges in designing covalent and noncovalent PL pro inhibitors [26] . The noncovalent naphthalene compound GRL0617 and its analogs are the major PL pro inhibitors with a validated mechanism of action [25] , [27] . Our recent study revealed a first-in-class rationally designed noncovalent inhibitor Jun12682 showing in vivo antiviral efficacy in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection [28] . Jun12682 binds to the same site as GRL0617 in the blocking loop 2 (BL2) region. In addition, Jun12682 extends to a previously unexplored binding site, Val70 Ub , which accounts for its high potency. In this work, we design a series of quinoline analogs to similarly target the Val70 Ub site. The X-ray crystal structures of PL pro with six lead compounds reveal interesting findings: while five compounds, Jun13317, Jun13306, Jun13307, Jun13308 , and Jun13296 have their 2-aryl substituent occupying the Val70 Ub site as expected, Jun12665 adopts a flipped orientation with the 2-pyrazolyl substitution fitting in the BL2 groove site. The in vivo lead Jun13296 displays more potent enzymatic inhibition and antiviral activity than the previously reported biarylphenyl inhibitor Jun12682 . In a SARS-CoV-2 infection mouse model, oral treatment of Jun13296 displays improved in vivo antiviral efficacy than Jun12682 . Collectively, Jun13296 represents a promising PL pro antiviral drug candidate for further development.",
