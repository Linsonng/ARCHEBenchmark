    "content": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths [1] . Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces lung cancer mortality by 20% in comparison with two-dimensional (2D) chest radiography in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) [2] and by 24% in comparison with no screening in the NELSON trial [3] . However, LCS faces challenges, such as the low screening rate (<10%) [4] , high false-positive rate [5] , sub-optimal workflows due to inadequate patient management [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] , under-utilization of multimodal data [10] , [11] , and particularly, a global shortage of radiologists for providing LCS. Hence, there is an important and immediate need for multidisciplinary efforts to broadly, equitably, and optimally implement LCS for minimized lung cancer mortality [12] . Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to improve the quality and efficiency of LCS significantly. In particular, there is a vast amount of multimodal data accumulated over the past years, including low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) images, patient demographics, smoking history, disease history, family cancer history, pathological results, follow-up data, etc. [2] LCS involves multiple clinical tasks, including lung nodule detection and characterization, Lung-RADS-based patient follow-up management, lung cancer risk estimation, and significant incidental findings such as diagnosis of various pulmonary, cardiovascular, and chest abnormalities. Deep learning methods achieved promising results for LCS-related tasks. For example, a deep learning method was proposed for lung cancer detection and risk estimation with LDCT in an end-to-end manner [13] . Recently, the Sybil model [14] was developed for lung cancer risk prediction using a single LDCT scan. In several studies [15] , [16] , deep learning models were developed for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk prediction with LDCT from LCS. Although promising, these LCS-related AI models were developed with relatively small single-modality datasets for individual tasks, limiting their performance and utility in the multitask LCS workflow. Additionally, the training schemes of current lung cancer risk models [13] , [14] require costly bounding box annotations, which makes building large-scale training datasets infeasible. In the fast-evolving AI field, foundation models (FMs) have shown previously unseen abilities to understand diverse data types and execute many tasks in a unified fashion [17] . Large FMs have updated the state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance across a wide range of tasks, such as natural language processing [18] , [19] , [20] , computer vision [21] , [22] , and multimodal understanding [23] , [24] , [25] . Inspired by these breakthroughs, increasing efforts have been made to develop medical foundation models, such as biomedical language models [26] , [27] , [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] , medical vision-language models [32] , [33] , [34] , and generalist medical AI models [35] , [36] , [37] . However, none of the existing FMs can effectively perform a variety of LCS tasks by interpreting the multimodal clinical data associated with LCS, particularly three-dimensional (3D) LDCT scans. This limitation is primarily due to challenges in data curation and model architecture. First, there is a high bar to systematically curate large-scale multimodal multitask datasets obtained in the real-world LCS workflow. Extensive domain-specific expertise and efforts are required to query, preprocess, and align 3D medical images and diverse structured/unstructured text-based clinical data with LCS-related tasks. Second, there is no scalable and adaptable foundation model dedicated to effectively interpreting multimodal LCS data, especially 3D CT images at different scales, and effectively performing diverse LCS-related tasks. Due to the high dimensionality of volumetric CT images, existing efforts only used small 2D/3D convolutional neural networks [38] and small vision Transformer models [39] at affordable computational costs. In this work, we present an integrated and scalable data curation approach to align high-dimensional medical images with other clinical datasets for LCS-related tasks, including 17 LCS workflow-related tasks and 49 data elements. Then, we develop a Medical Multimodal Multitask Foundation Model (M3FM) that perceives multimodal data including 3D CT volumes and various other clinical data, and performs multiple tasks involved in the LCS workflow. Figure 1 illustrates the M3FM architecture, along with its training and inference processes. Extensive experiments show that our M3FM outperforms the previous SoTA models through large-scale multimodal and multitask learning, with the ability to identify informative data elements and adapt to the out-of-distribution task with a small dataset. Fig. 1: Overview of medical multimodal multitask foundation model (M3FM). a M3FM architecture consists of four components: Computed Tomography Vision Transformer (CTViT), Text Transformer, Task Encoder, and Predictors. b Pretraining CTViT on multiscale CT volumes with voxel size-aware masked image modeling. Scale 1, Scale 2, ⋯ , and Scale S denote S different sizes of images. c Pretraining Text Transformer with masked image models, where T1, T2, ⋯ , and T5 denote a sequence of text tokens, T1, T2, and T4 are inputs, T3 and T5 are targets, and MASK is a special token meaning that the input token is masked. d Training the shared M3FM jointly with flexible multimodal and synergistic multitask learning using our distributed task-parallel strategy. Each device focuses on a single task with task-specific inputs, targets, and loss functions. D , N , and R denote the numbers of different devices, tasks, and image regions, respectively. Different tasks may have the same multimodal inputs on devices 1 and 2 and various multimodal or single-modality inputs on devices 2, 3, 4, and 5. e M3FM inference flexibly handles multi-scale CT volumes (indicated by the rectangle boxes in different sizes and colors), clinical data, and multiple tasks. The colors of the CT bounding boxes match those of the questions and the predicted answers. For example, to answer Question 16, M3FM takes the orange region in the CT volume automatically localized using an organ localization model, the corresponding voxel size, and clinical text data as inputs. Questions 17 and 18 are two examples of auxiliary information retrieval tasks for clinical data modeling, which only take the clinical text as input. Question 19 predicts the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) from lung nodule descriptions in a radiology report. reticular/... /scar reticular/reticulonodular opacities/honeycombing/fibrosis/scar, where / means or, COVID-19 Coronavirus Disease 2019.
