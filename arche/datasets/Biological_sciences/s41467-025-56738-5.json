    "content": "Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV) are a leading platform for clinical DNA delivery. This vector system is derived from a human parvovirus and has many inherent features that make it attractive for human gene therapy applications [1] . It also has some inherent limitations, the major one of which is the small genetic payload. The unenveloped 25 nm capsid can package no more than 5 kb of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) into its small lumen [2] , [3] , imposing a size limit to the coding and regulatory elements that can be included in the transgene cassette. For gene replacement therapies, current strategies employ cDNA versions of the gene of interest, with expression driven by a short, strong promoter such as CMV [4] . While this accommodates many therapeutically relevant gene sizes, it excludes other larger genes, such as dystrophin or the most accurate Cas9 versions and other base editors. Moreover, CMV and similar promoters are ubiquitously expressed at very high levels, leading to off-target expression in non-therapeutically relevant tissues, and potentially toxic levels of transgene expression. This can lead to immune responses and other failures of the therapy. A larger payload size is therefore highly desirable for expressing large proteins and moreover for enabling fine-tuned spatiotemporal control over expression and levels by inclusion of more diverse, efficient regulatory sequences. The wild-type (wt) AAV virus and the recombinant AAV vector have the same overall structure, consisting only of the 60mer icosahedral capsid with one packaged ssDNA vector genome (VG). Viral proteins are required during production for replication and packaging, but no viral enzymes are packaged within the virion [5] . VG architecture requires flanking the desired delivery DNA with the viral inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences at both ends [6] . The ITR contains sequence elements that are required during viral replication and also direct packaging into the preformed capsids for vector production [7] . In the transduction process (Fig. 1A ), the capsid traffics the VG to the host/target cell nucleus, where the capsid is shed (termed uncoating) [8] , [9] . The ssDNA VG is converted to dsDNA through unclear mechanisms which enables transgene expression. Individual VGs can also circularize through intramolecular ITR-ITR joining and concatenate through intermolecular ITR-ITR joining [10] . In its recombinant form, where a capsid of choice is packaged with an ITR-flanked transgene, rAAV VGs cannot replicate; but instead multiple VGs enter the nucleus and can concatenate into large episomal species [11] . The absence of delivered enzymes implies that the post-uncoating nuclear steps of rAAV transduction are orchestrated by host cellular factors. Decades of observation have articulated the nuclear steps of transduction—uncoating, conversion to dsDNA, concatenation, expression—yet they remain observations, with little mechanistic detail and knowledge of facilitating host factors [12] , [13] . Fig. 1: Dual Vectors are inefficient. A Schematic of recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector genome (VG) processing. Single-stranded DNA VGs are converted to double-stranded (ds)DNA and VGs circularize and concatenate by inverted terminal repeat (ITR)-ITR joining, through unclear mechanisms. VGs associate with histones, but when this occurs during these processes is unknown. B The dual vector approach can double payload size by exploiting the natural concatenation process. A large gene is split into separate Left (L) and Right (R) VGs; inclusion of a splice donor (SD)/acceptor (SA) excludes the ITR junction from the final transcript. C Reporter constructs to assay split transgene reconstitution. LacZ is split between L and R VGs in a trans-splicing (TS) pair that requires ITR-ITR concatenation for expression, or a Hybrid (HB) trans-splicing plus Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) partial sequence previously demonstrated to increase split transgene reconstitution efficiency. An unsplit LacZ VG is used as a control. CMV = cytomegalovirus. BSD = Blasticidin resistance. pA = poly A signal. F2A, P2A, T2A = 2A self-cleaving peptides. D LacZ Activated Fluorescence Assay (LAFA) schematic: cultured cells are transduced with equimolar doses of L and R vectors. After 48 h, split transgene reconstitution is assayed by Beta-galactosidase (LacZ) activity cleaving 4-Methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (MUG), a fluorogenic beta galactose analog. E U2-OS cells were treated with 1e4 VG/cell of the split pairs or unsplit LacZ diagrammed in ( C ). LAFA was performed at 48 hours post transduction and quantified by flow cytometry: L + R pairs (magenta, purple), unsplit vector (blue, green), or empty capsid (black) negative control are plotted as a histogram. All capsids and ITRs are AAV2. Full size image The absence of viral enzymes in the rAAV particle implies that the processes of VG circularization and concatenation are orchestrated by host cellular factors. ITR-ITR joining is analogous to host DNA repair mechanisms, and dsDNA VGs could conceivably resemble a chromosomal break. The host cell has many ways of repairing DNA damage, including two main pathways to repair double-strand breaks (DSB): the high-fidelity but restricted activity pathway called Homologous Recombination (HR) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR), and the constitutively active but error-prone pathway of Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) [14] . The MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex, which recognizes free DNA ends to facilitate repair upstream of HDR versus NHEJ pathway choice, recognizes ITRs but inhibits concatenation [15] , [16] . The NHEJ pathway has been suggested to play a role in concatenation since depletion or inhibition of the NHEJ factor DNA-PKcs reduces VG concatenation [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , [21] . However, the effect of HDR pathway on concatenation has not been directly examined. The propensity of VGs to concatenate can be exploited to increase the final genetic payload size [22] . In this “dual vector” approach (Fig. 1A, B ), a large transgene cassette is split into two halves, packaged into separate capsids, and co-delivered to target cells. Inclusion of a splice donor in the “Left” half VG (L) and a splice acceptor in the “Right” half VG (R) allows the ITR junction to be spliced out during RNA processing of transcription, and the large gene is subsequently reconstituted in the transcript. This technique was first developed in the early 2000s by multiple groups independently [23] , [24] , [25] . To be effective it requires correct, directional, and stoichiometric concatenation, followed by correct expression. By nature of the sequence, any ITR can in theory join any ITR, leading to many permutations that do not all lead to correct split transgene reconstitution. The approach also currently relies on very high vector doses. To increase the chances of L and R genomes joining in the correct orientation, a short fragment of the Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) gene serendipitously found to be “highly recombinogenic” in the dual vector context [26] can be added between the splice signal and the ITR [27] . It is presumed that the AP fragment promotes annealing of + and – sense VGs which then become a reconstituted large gene through HR. However, HR has never been directly tested as the mechanism of concatenation. Indeed, AP inclusion significantly increases efficiency and is now commonly used in dual vectors, but like general mechanisms of concatenation, little is known about the mechanisms underpinning the AP phenomenon. Here, we aim to improve dual vector transduction by an alternative approach that focuses on the host cell. We first identify cellular pathways inhibitory to split transgene reconstitution by a genome-wide screen. We provide evidence for early chromatinization of VGs, and epigenetic recognition as a double-strand break. Surprisingly, blocking HR increases both concatenation of and expression from rAAV VGs, which dramatically increases dual vector transduction efficiencies. Our findings suggest that HR is the “first responder” to the DSB-flagged VGs, but that NHEJ is a more efficient mechanism for VG concatenation. While the majority of efforts to improve rAAV gene therapies have focused on modifying the vector and dose, our findings emphasize the importance of understanding host responses in the target cell. Our results highlight the potential for pharmacological approaches to enhance efficiency and increase deliverable transgene size in rAAV gene therapies.",
