    "content": "Bacteria constantly experience various fluctuating conditions in nature, including many conditions that cause cellular stress. Appropriate sensing and adaptation to stressors is therefore important for cell survival and growth. The soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis and related gram-positive bacteria have evolved a wide variety of ways to sense, respond to, and survive environmental stresses. One prominent way that these bacteria protect against non-lethal stress is termed the general stress response (GSR), which is regulated by the alternative sigma factor σ B [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] . In B. subtilis , σ B activates the general stress regulon, comprising some 200 genes [6] , [7] , [8] , in response to energy or environmental stress. Energy stress includes starvation for nutrients and factors such as glucose, phosphate, and oxygen as well as treatments that limit biological processes, such as rifampicin, azide, and mycophenolic acid [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] . Environmental and physical stressors include salt, ethanol, heat, acid, sodium nitroprusside, and blue light [9] , [10] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] . σ B controls the GSR in several other gram-positive bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes [19] , [20] , [21] , [22] , [23] , B. licheniformis [24] , [25] , B. cereus [26] , and Staphylococcus aureus [27] , [28] , [29] , [30] . In B. subtilis , σ B activity is ultimately controlled by the RsbVW partner-switching mechanism. In unstressed cells, σ B is held inactive by the anti-sigma factor RsbW, which prevents its interaction with core RNA polymerase [31] , [32] , [33] , [34] . RsbW is also the kinase of RsbV, the anti-anti-sigma factor of σ B [35] . Upon stress exposure, RsbV becomes dephosphorylated, making it a preferred partner for RsbW; RsbW releases σ B in favor of binding RsbV, allowing σ B to activate its regulon. RsbV is dephosphorylated by two known serine/threonine phosphatases, RsbP and RsbU (Fig. 1A ) [36] , [37] , [38] . Energy stress activates RsbP, whereas environmental stress activates RsbU [9] , [37] , [39] . RsbU phosphatase activity is activated by interaction with RsbT (Fig. 1A ) [40] , [41] , [42] . The availability of RsbT to activate RsbU is controlled by sequestration of RsbT in large cytoplasmic complexes termed stressosomes [43] , [44] , which are only known to control σ B in a subset of species, including B. subtilis , B. licheniformis , and L. monocytogenes , but are also present in a number of other bacteria [45] , [46] . Fig. 1: Impact of Ala substitutions in the putative sensing region of RsbRA on the σ B response using a complementation strategy. A Schematic of the B. subtilis general stress response. Environmental stress is thought to be sensed by stressosome complexes composed of a mixed population of 40 RsbR paralogs (different shades of red) and 20 RsbS proteins (gray) that sequester RsbT proteins (blue). Stress sensation leads to release of RsbT, which then activates downstream steps leading to release of σ B . Energy stress is sensed separately, by the proteins RsbQ and RsbP, but the final steps leading to σ B release are the same. B Schematic of the RsbRA protein showing the region of residues from 11 to 58 (red) that was subjected to individual Ala substitutions. Mutant rsbRA genes were added back at amyE together with rsbU to a strain background lacking all rsbR genes, ytvA , rsbP (to deactivate the energy stress pathway), and rsbU . The strain carried a σ B -responsive P rsbV - lacZ reporter to assess the general stress response. C Cartoon of predicted results, with a nonfunctional or unstable RsbRA predicted to yield a constitutive σ B response even without stress (green line), and a sensing-dead version of RsbRA unable to activate in the presence of stress (red line). The black line is the same wild-type data shown in other figure panels, showing the mean of biological triplicate experiments, with the shading indicating standard deviation. D – F Graphs showing β-galactosidase activity from P rsbV as a proxy for σ B activity (measured at 15-min intervals for 3 h) upon stimulation of the general stress response with 3% ethanol. WT indicates complementation of the reporter strain with rsbU and wild-type rsbRA at amyE as the only source of RsbR in the cell (CSS744; black trace). No RsbRA or U indicates the uncomplemented recipient strain (CSS716; gray trace). Substitutions (e.g., “T38A”) indicate complementation of the reporter strain with rsbU and Ala-substituted rsbRA as indicated at amyE as the only source of RsbR in the cell. All traces are means of biological triplicate experiments, with the shading indicating standard deviation. D Substitutions resulting in increased (>10% increased from wild-type) peak σ B activity. E Substitutions resulting in decreased (>10% decreased from wild-type) peak σ B activity. F Substitutions resulting in unchanged (within 10% of wild-type) peak σ B activity. G Color-coded sequence logo showing the impact of Ala substitutions. Red, decreased; blue, unchanged; green and bold, increased; black, untested; gray, unsubstituted (already Ala).

Full size image Each stressosome is a 1.8-MDa protein complex, comprising 20 RsbR dimers and 20 copies of RsbS, that can bind and sequester up to 20 copies of RsbT that are released upon onset of stress [43] , [47] . RsbR and RsbS proteins both include a STAS (sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist) domain [48] ; these domains form the core structure of the stressosome complex, with the RsbR N-terminal domains oriented outward into the cytoplasm [47] . In contrast to RsbS, which contains only the STAS domain, RsbR proteins bear conserved (45–50% sequence identity) STAS domains in their C-terminal half, and less-conserved (17–22% sequence identity) N-terminal non-heme globin dimers (Fig. 1B ) [47] , [49] , [50] . B. subtilis encodes five intact RsbR paralogs, RsbRA, RsbRB, RsbRC, and RsbRD, and a blue light sensor called YtvA; these are presumably mixed within stressosomes at an unknown stoichiometry [51] . The stressosome is thought to somehow sense environmental stress and to activate the serine/threonine kinase activity of RsbT to phosphorylate RsbS at S59 coincidently with the release of RsbT from the stressosome (Fig. 1A ) to activate RsbU and, consequently, σ B [40] , [41] , [42] , [43] , [52] . In this model, the release of RsbT is the central event in the environmental stress sensing pathway. The elevated σ B levels resulting from environmental stress are reversed by the activity of a phosphatase, RsbX, which dephosphorylates RsbS and presumably allows RsbT recapture [42] , [53] . Despite the availability of detailed structural information on the stressosome, it is not clear how stress is sensed by the stressosome or how RsbT kinase activity is activated. One attractive model is that RsbR proteins serve as sensors and as activators of RsbT kinase activity towards S59 of RsbS [54] . The outward orientation of the RsbR globin dimers in the cryo-EM structure of the wild-type B. subtilis stressosome [47] is consistent with a sensing function. Additionally, YtvA senses blue light using a PAS/LOV (light-oxygen-voltage) domain in the N-terminal half of the protein [51] , [55] , [56] , and heme-binding RsbR orthologs in Vibrio species sense oxygen [57] , [58] . The RsbR paralogs are distinct with respect to σ B response profiles (i.e., timing and magnitude) when subjected to different environmental stressors [59] , [60] , showing that RsbR proteins impact σ B responses; this is at least consistent with a sensory function. However, substitutions in the linker that would presumably be important for communicating sensory information between the N-terminal globin and C-terminal STAS domains of RsbRA impacted steady-state output but not stress sensitivity [61] , and a similar result was obtained for specific point mutations in the N-terminal domain [50] , including mutations that interfered with RsbT-stressosome interactions in vitro [49] . Moreover, the putative outcome of RsbR stress sensing, namely stimulation of RsbT kinase activity, is not necessary for σ B activation, as reduced signaling still occurs even in mutant strains with unphosphorylatable RsbS [62] . Hence, experimental evidence for stress sensing by RsbRs has remained elusive, despite several well-designed inquiries. Here, we sought experimental evidence for RsbR-mediated stress sensing using RsbRA as a model. We reasoned that the N-terminal regions of RsbR proteins might include amino acid residues that are important for environmental stress sensing, and we systematically engineered a larger number of substitutions in the putative N-terminal sensing domain than in previous studies. We found that these substitutions influenced the magnitude and duration of the σ B response to ethanol, a classic stressor, but that none was critical for stress sensing. Our results prompted us to reexamine the requirement for the stressosome (i.e., RsbRs and RsbS) in environmental stress sensing. Surprisingly, we found that cells deleted for stressosomes retained an environmental stress-inducible σ B response that strictly depended on RsbT. Collectively, our data refine the model for stressosome function, showing that RsbT can mediate stressosome-independent environmental sensing and consistent with a sensing role for RsbT, with the stressosome primarily serving to modulate the strength and timing of the σ B response.",
