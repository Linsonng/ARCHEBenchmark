    "content": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS), which quantify the genetic risk for traits from common variants, have improved in their predictive performances over the past decade [1] . Building on classical approaches of pruning and thresholding, methods incorporating Bayesian approaches using prior knowledge about genetic architecture, relatedness of individuals, linkage disequilibrium patterns, and genetic effects across populations have improved the assignment of variant weights and PRS performance [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] . In parallel, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have continued to expand in size, with the most recent iteration of the GWASs for human height and coronary artery disease reaching 5.4 million and 1.3 million participants, respectively [6] , [7] . The incorporation of multi-ancestry and multi-trait GWAS data has further improved PRS prediction in diverse ancestral groups [8] . In attempting to quantify total inherited risk, each of these PRS iterations for a given trait captures unique information contingent on source GWAS, method, and training dataset. PRS are increasingly being delivered to patients. Third-party genetic testing companies and healthcare system laboratories are already delivering polygenic scores for coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancers, and other diseases [9] , [10] . The eMERGE consortium has developed PRS reports for 10 diseases to return to participants within the healthcare system as part of a larger effort to study genomic risk assessment and management [11] , [12] , [13] . Furthermore, researchers recently developed clinically valid assays, clinical workflows, and patient- and physician-oriented information materials to accompany PRS reports delivered within the Mass General Brigham Biobank and the Veterans Affairs Genomic Medicine at Veterans Affairs (GenoVA) Study [14] , [15] . New clinical trials are incorporating PRS into medical decision-making (NCT05819814, NCT05850091), and medical societies have begun to release initial statements on their utility [16] , [17] . Although consistency in risk classification is important for clinical decision-making, risk prediction models for complex diseases will inherently have variability in high-risk classification. These differences often stem from differences in training population, outcome definition, and underlying statistical methodology. Even though different risk prediction models may be correlated at their mean, extreme value theory suggests they are inherently likely to differ in classifying risk in the extremes [18] . The introduction of new models often leads to significant reclassification of high-risk risk among patients, raising questions about the need for altering recommendations for interventions or therapies. For example, since 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (AHA) have recommended using the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) [19] to estimate the 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but the AHA recently developed the Predicting Risk of CVD EVENTs (PREVENT) equations [20] , which include kidney measures, exclude race, and include heart failure in the composite predicted outcome. When applied to representative cohorts, PREVENT predicts lower cardiovascular risk than PCE and could reclassify about half of US adults to lower risk categories, potentially leading to reduced statin and antihypertensive treatment eligibility and increasing incidence of composite cardiovascular outcomes [21] . Similarly, current reports of polygenic risk also provide a categorical assessment of high risk, and different studies and companies use different scores for the same traits [9] , [10] , [11] . As advances in GWAS size and statistical methods continue to fuel the release of improved new PRS, a framework is needed for updating scores or incorporating new data without causing confusion. Despite ongoing progress toward clinical implementation, the variability of individual-level classification of ‘high genetic risk’ using different PRS for a given trait remains largely untested, and consensus PRS for any trait currently does not exist. Previous efforts have focused on population-level prediction metrics, rather than consistency of high-risk classification presented in individual clinical reports now as a part of clinical implementation workflows [8] . Prior limited availability of large holdout diverse datasets has precluded individual-level benchmarking to assess agreement in classification between PRS. Furthermore, there is a need to aggregate and incorporate orthogonal data from available PRS while overcoming the correlation between scores and maximize predictive performance. In this work, we use the large and ancestrally-diverse All of Us (AOU) cohort [22] to compare the classification of individuals with high genetic risk based on published polygenic scores for three common, complex diseases: coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and major depressive disorder (MDD). We also test the effect of using PRSmix [23] — a tool that agnostically integrates information across several PRS for a given trait to improve prediction accuracy for a target population — in influencing high genetic risk classification over iterations of polygenic scores. We find extreme disagreement regarding individual-level high-risk classification between published scores and observe how integrative scoring via PRSmix mitigates this instability.",
