    "content": "Huntington’s disease (HD) is a genetic, progressive neurodegenerative disease, which manifests with characteristic motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms that arise generally at midlife and progress during 10 to 15 years, with subtle signs that can appear decades earlier. The disease is caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the Huntingtin ( HTT) gene, which produces mutant HTT with polyglutamine expansion (polyQ) [1] , [2] . Specific neurons, particularly direct and indirect spiny projection neurons (dSPN and iSPN, respectively) in the striatum, representing >95% of striatal neurons, are highly vulnerable to the HD mutation [3] , [4] . Molecular underpinning of striatal neuron vulnerability in HD remains elusive. Epigenetic alteration is a key hallmark of cellular aging [5] , [6] . Recent study shows that cellular aging is caused by loss of cellular identity resulting from erosion of epigenetic information, so-called exdifferentiation [7] . Histone modifications, including the active mark H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and the repressive mark H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), were used as proxy to assess exdifferentiation, which is characterized by de-repression of non-lineage-specific genes, particularly developmental genes, and repression of cellular identity genes, both mechanisms contributing to cellular identity loss [7] . Epigenomic analyses in bulk HD striatal tissue show early loss of H3K27ac at striatal super-enhancers -broad enhancers regulating cellular identity genes, which results in transcriptional downregulation of their targets, striatal identity genes [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] . However, due to lack of cellular and temporal resolutions of earlier analyses, it was unclear whether HD vulnerable neurons undergo accelerated epigenetic aging, including accelerated de-repression of developmental genes. Here, we investigated HD striatal epigenetic landscape using fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) coupled to ChIPseq or CUT&Tag. We profiled neuronal and non-neuronal striatal cells in two reference HD mouse models, R6/1 transgenic and Q140 knockin (KI) mice, showing distinct disease progressions. Additionally, we performed temporal analysis at 3 ages, corresponding to prodromal, early and advanced pathological stages in HD Q140 mice. We targeted H3K27me3, histone acetylation marks (e.g., H3K27ac, H3K9ac, H3K18ac) as well as H2AK119ub, since our analyses highlighted altered regulation of PRC1 subunits in HD striatal neurons. Our data show that the HD mutation accelerates loss of epigenetic information associated with cellular aging in striatal neurons of HD mice. Particularly, epigenetic de-repression of developmental genes is dramatically accelerated and our data indicate that the mechanism involves PRC1 through paralog switching among PRC1-CBX genes. Together, our data support the view that PRC1-mediated accelerated epigenetic aging is a key mechanism underlying striatal neuron vulnerability in HD.",
