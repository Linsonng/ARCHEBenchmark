    "content": "Capillary waves, also known as ripples, are surface tension -dominated mechanical perturbations of a liquid-gas interface. Evocations date back at least to the first century AD, when Pliny the Elder was reporting on the absence of ripples in the wake of ships releasing surfactants [1] . The earliest description of capillary waves in the modern scientific sense is attributed to John Scott Russell [2] . His investigation portrayed the orbital motion of the water molecules carried on by the swelling interface and measured propagation speeds in the range 0.2–0.9 m s −1 . The influence of a nearby seabed on the wave motion has been first assessed for the case of gravity-driven waves with longer wavelength λ , in a configuration of intermediate depth of the water medium, with a first linear model proposed by Sir Airy in 1841 [3] , further developed to account for weak nonlinear effects by Sir Stokes [4] in 1847. Later extensions to these models would consider e.g., high wave steepness [5] and pure capillary waves [6] . Together, these works would contribute in particular to describing a wavenumber-to-frequency relation, commonly called dispersion relation. For a wave travelling at an interface between two fluid phases (i.e., an interfacial wave) a and b , the angular frequency Ω( k ) writes $${\\Omega }^{2}(k)=\\frac{gk\\mid{\\rho }_{{{{\\rm{a}}}}}-{\\rho }_{{{{\\rm{b}}}}}\\mid+\\sigma{k}^{3}}{{\\rho }_{{{{\\rm{a}}}}}\\coth (k{h}_{{{{\\rm{a}}}}})+{\\rho }_{{{{\\rm{b}}}}}\\coth (k{h}_{{{{\\rm{b}}}}})},$$ (1) where g and σ are gravity and surface tension. k = 2 π / λ is the wavenumber. ρ a and h a (respectively, ρ b and h b ) are the density and thickness of the fluid phase a (respectively, b ). At an air-water interface, a minimum for the wave propagation speed, here referred to as the phase speed c p = Ω( k )/ k , can be found for λ ≃ 1.7 cm and equals ca . 0.23 m s −1 , in a condition of deep water ( h ≫ λ ). Interfacial waves on water are generally categorised, according to their wavelength into two distinct groups, capillary ( λ ≤ 1.7 cm) and gravity ( λ ≥ 1.7 cm) waves, mainly governed by distinct restoring forces, respectively surface tension and gravity [7] . Capillary and gravity waves are dispersive, meaning that their propagation speed depends on their wavelength, according to Eq. ( 1 ), a graphical representation of which is provided as Supplementary Information ( SI ), in Fig. S1 . The wave-driven orbital motion of water molecules constrained by a shallow water configuration ( h ≪ λ ) experiences a no-slip boundary condition at the water-bottom interface [8] , causing the wave to slow down [3] and its amplitude to increase [9] . This effect is known as wave shoaling and is opposed to the restoring forces, such as gravity and interfacial tensions, which try to restore the equilibrium state. The pinning contact of the water interface to the walls of a channel in which a wave travels can also exert an additional restoring force, opposite to the interface displacement, which further stiffens the gas-water interface [10] and speeds up the wave propagation [10] , [11] . This effect is intensified, when the wall spacing is narrowed [12] and the water interface becomes curved [13] . In contrast, a condition of freely moving contact line agrees with the theory of waves on constraint-free interfaces [10] , [14] . Together, this abundant literature constitutes in-depth knowledge of water waves in various configurations, which all share a common determinant, namely the assumption that the air or gas phase above the water interface is boundary-free and inviscid. While capillary waves have been extensively studied in free conditions (e.g., deep water) [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] and in constrained conditions (e.g., shallow water or narrow channel) [3] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , to the best of our knowledge, systematic studies on capillary waves at an interface constrained by its pinning to an array of microstructures are still lacking. Such conditions could be facilitated by the superhydrophobic state exhibiting a superior water repellency. Nature itself offers fascinating examples, such as lotus [15] and salvinia [16] leaves, aquatic arthropod exoskeletons [17] , feathers [18] , serving as remarkable sources of inspiration [19] . Superhydrophobicity is enabled by a combination of surface chemistry [20] and nano-micro topography, which prevents liquid entry and impalement [20] , [21] . Underwater immersion, a thin layer of air is trapped between the micropillars, where the micropillar tops support the water like a fakir on a bed of nails. Collectively, this is known as a plastron, or the Cassie state [22] . However, the water-repellent feature can be compromised by spontaneous changes in the environment [20] . In particular, the plastron can experience depletion as a result of gas dissolution or pressure-induced impalement [23] , [24] . Eventually, the plastron could be lost and the surface fully wetted, the so-called Wenzel state [25] , while partially wet states would be here referred to as intermediate states. The plastron condition is typically assessed optically by bright-field microscopy [23] , [26] , total internal reflection technique [24] , [27] , or confocal microscopy [28] . Acoustics-based alternatives to optics [21] show limitations due to (i) complexity and cost related to integrating a transducer into the studied surface [29] , [30] , or (ii) lack of access to the plastron dynamics and intermediate wetting states [31] . Mechanical waves carry their propagation medium’s properties, making them useful tools for investigating optically opaque or contamination-sensitive media, such as, respectively, the Earth’s crust [32] and biological tissues [33] , or soft matter and biological fluids [34] , [35] . With this in mind, the examination of the dynamics of the gas-water interface, constrained by microstructures, in response to mechanical stress could provide a means for remotely monitoring the plastron’s condition, wetting state, and spontaneous gas diffusion over time. Accordingly, this work presents an original configuration of capillary waves induced by ultrasound (US), travelling on a gas-water interface bounded to the solid microstructures of a superhydrophobic plastron. The wave behaviour is studied by varying the density of the three-phase contact line and the pillar height. The sensing potential of these waves for remotely monitoring the plastron and its intermediate wetting state is eventually addressed.",
