    "content": "Nickel-rich LiNi x Mn y Co z O 2 ( x ≥ 0.8, NMC) layered positive electrode materials with high specific capacity (≥200 mAh/g) hold great potential for high-energy lithium batteries, the most significant power devices for long-range electric vehicles. However, the cycling stability of nickel-rich positive electrode material is still unsatisfactory at present, especially at high voltages. The severe structural and chemo-mechanical degradation results in rapid capacity decay of these positive electrode materials during cycling, and the capacity decay is accelerated with an increase of Ni content in materials [1] . The surface stability plays a vital role in nickel-rich positive electrode materials, because their performance deterioration can initiate at the surface due to parasitic reactions with the electrolyte, transition metal dissolution, and surface reconstruction [2] , [3] , [4] . Moreover, the surface stability of NMCs is related to their bulk chemo-mechanical stability during cycling. Due to the mutual modulation between surface chemistry and bulk microstructure, a higher surface structural stability can alleviate anisotropic stress formation in NMC polycrystalline particles [5] , [6] . To mitigate surface instability of NMCs, researchers have built functional layers on positive particles or prepared NMCs with an elemental concentration gradient and core-shell structure [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] . A surface coating layer such as Al 2 O 3 can enhance the cycling stability of NMCs by suppressing undesired side reactions with the electrolyte and lowering interfacial charge transfer impendence [11] . The concentration gradient NMCs exhibit improved long-term cycle life through enhancing structural stability with a Mn-rich surface layer. However, the effectiveness of these strategies depends on the capability to precisely control the synthesis conditions [12] , [13] . Considering that the capacity delivery and electrochemical kinetics of positive electrode materials are associated with reversible Li ion (de)intercalation throughout entire battery particles, the structural and chemical evolution in the bulk of NMC particles should be considered when investigating degradation mechanisms upon cycling. Researchers have introduced heteroatoms into the NMC lattice, which may mitigate undesired bulk degradation [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] . However, due to the crystallographic anisotropy, it is unlikely to make zero-strain layered positive electrode materials although from time to time one may claim minimal volume changes upon cycling. Due to their high Young’s moduli, a seemingly insignificant strain can still lead to high mechanical stress. Meanwhile, it is non-trivial to precisely place heteroatoms in the desired site of NMC lattice. Another hardly discussed drawback of doping chemistry, especially those with multiple dopants, is the vulnerable raw materials supply chain. Adding more elements means a more complex raw materials supply chain. It is within such context that controlling materials microstructures without excessively using dopants has become an attractive strategy for long-term manufacturing reliability [6] , [19] , [20] , [21] . As a key step in positive electrode material manufacturing, the calcination process can drive mass transport and reaction kinetics to redistribute constituting elements to become either homogeneously or heterogeneously distributed in NMC secondary particles [22] . In a typical NMC calcination, the ramping and cooling rates are controlled at a few or tens of degrees per minute. Quenching can produce materials far from equilibrium. Quenching from the peak of the calcination temperature to low temperature has been shown to increase the reversible capacity of lithium titanate negative electrodes [23] . Some studies adopted a similar quenching treatment for Ni-rich positive electrode materials and found that Ni-rich positive electrodes could deliver enhanced electrochemical performance after the quenching treatment [24] , [25] . It has remained largely unexplored regarding how quenching can change the mutual modulation between the surface and bulk of layered positive electrode particles and thus impact battery performance. If successful, such a thermal treatment can reduce the overall calcination duration and become an effective strategy to tailor battery performance. Herein, we report quenching as a strategy to simultaneously mitigate surface structural degradation and address the bulk charge distribution heterogeneity issue. We manipulate elemental distribution in NMC polycrystalline particles by regulating the cooling rate from the peak of calcination temperature. We observe substantial lithium diffusion from the bulk to the surface of NMC polycrystalline particles, creating a surface Ni reduction layer to decrease the surface reactivity. Subsequent X-ray spectroscopic and imaging analyses show the improved surface stability allows the redox reactions to proceed more homogeneously throughout polycrystalline particles and results in more favorable capacity retention cycled to high voltages. Our work provides insights into regulating the mutual modulation between surface chemistry and bulk charging reactions within polycrystalline layered positive electrode particles.",
