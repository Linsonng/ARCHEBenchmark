    "content": "Fabricating objects with complex geometry has become much simpler thanks to additive manufacturing. Light-based 3D printing exploits the ability of certain light-sensitive molecules to trigger polymerization or crosslinking reactions in liquid resins, thus solidifying them. Photopolymerization can be produced sequentially, as in stereolithography [1] or digital light processing [2] , [3] , and more recently also volumetrically, as in two-photon polymerization [4] , [5] , light-sheet microprinting [6] , holographic multi-beam interference [7] , or tomographic volumetric additive manufacturing [8] , [9] . By printing in a volumetric fashion, support struts are no longer needed, enabling the fabrication of designs with cavities and overhangs. In Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (TVAM), an entire three-dimensional object is simultaneously solidified by irradiating a volume of photocurable liquid resin from multiple angles with dynamic light patterns until the photocurable resin reaches a polymerization dose threshold [8] , [10] . Unlike most other additive manufacturing methods, TVAM is layer-less, meaning that it does not fabricate objects by solidifying one voxel, line, or layer at a time. Instead, light from sequential tomographic patterns builds up an energy dose that approximates the volume of the target object. Typical printing times are tens of seconds [11] for cm-scale prints with resolutions down to 50–80 μm [9] , [12] using high-power laser diodes [9] , [13] , [14] . Additionally, the technique has proven versatile and has been used to fabricate objects in materials such as acrylates, thiol-enes [12] , [15] , [16] , [17] , nanoparticle-loaded composites [12] , polymer-derived ceramics [18] , epoxies [19] , silk bioinks [20] , and cell-laden hydrogels [10] , [21] , [22] . Implementations of tomographic VAM rely on the Radon transform (ray optics) to compute the light amplitude patterns. Essentially, different techniques have been used to improve the light dose delivered to the photoresin. Due to the positive constraint applied to the intensity patterns after the Filtered Back Projection (FBP), the computed projection patterns produce a 3D dose with artifacts [22] , [23] . The dose threshold required to solidify the photosensitive resin provides an additional degree of freedom for improved shape fidelity. Iterative optimization schemes that use appropriate error functions to minimize printed voxel errors have proven to be very effective [8] , [24] , [25] . The diffusion of inhibiting molecules has been modeled as a convolution operation and shown to improve fidelity [26] . Additionally, including 3D imaging methods during fabrication can be used to experimentally correct for oxygen diffusion or other effects such as temperature-induced reaction kinetics [9] , [26] , [27] , [28] . The Radon transform assumes straight rays to compute the projected light patterns. Projection patterns can be thought of as “extruded” two-dimensional patterns that propagate as a collimated beam. In practice, this is implemented by imaging a two-dimensional spatial light modulator into a cylindrical vial containing the photoresin and relying on the depth of focus of the imaging system to maintain a quasi-collimated image. If the vial’s diameter is much larger than the depth of focus, blurring artifacts appear and compromise the resolution [9] , [14] . The space-bandwidth product of the light source is a key optical parameter, as it determines the depth of focus. A diffraction-limited spot has the lowest space bandwidth product. Additionally, in this type of optical imaging configuration, the two-dimensional spatial light modulator modulates only the intensity, not the phase. Typically, digital micromirror devices (DMD) are used as reflective binary amplitude modulators in light-based 3D printers including TVAM. Here, one pixel on the 2D modulator corresponds to one pixel in the relayed image. In this work, we propose a light engine that harnesses the phase properties of the light beam. We term this technique HoloVAM. Phase encoding of tomographic projections offers multiple advantages over amplitude modulation. First, phase-encoding improves light efficiency, as all pixels of the display can contribute to the projected intensity pattern. Since tomographic projection patterns typically exhibit high spatial frequency information, most pixels are dark. Amplitude encoding is therefore highly inefficient: typically, less than 1% of the incident light reaches the vial. Second, phase-encoding allows a modification of the point spread function (PSF) to be encoded within the same hologram, allowing 3D digital control of the light beam, for example, by increasing the depth of focus using an Axicon phase to generate a Bessel beam, or by multi-plane projections of the same pattern by adding phases of Fresnel lenses, effectively creating a low-divergence projection. A self-healing beam, generated using a Helical Phase Plate (HPP) to produce an Optical Vortex (OV), enables printing within scattering materials. Herein, we use a projection system that converts a two-dimensional phase modulator to a two-dimensional intensity pattern in the Fourier plane. All pixels on the modulator contribute, by interference, to all pixels on the image plane. There are multiple iterative algorithms or machine learning approaches [29] that can generate two-dimensional input phase patterns to produce a user-specified intensity distribution in a desired plane or volume. The Gerchberg–Saxton (GS) iterative algorithm is one of the many methods to calculate a two-dimensional input phase pattern, which results in a desired intensity distribution pattern at the optical Fourier plane [30] . Binary holograms computed with the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm and encoded with Lee holograms have recently been used to control multiple foci in two-photon lithography, thereby increasing printing speed [31] . In our approach, we demonstrate the use of phase encoding in tomographic VAM by printing millimeter-scale objects in an acrylate-based resin and in a hydrogel based on Gelatin Metacryloyl (GelMA) loaded with cells at a concentration of 0.5 million cells per mL. We demonstrate a printing time of less than 60 s with a single continuous-wave 40 mW laser diode at 405 nm (coupled with an efficiency of 33% in a single mode fiber) and reach negative features (holes) of 31.35 μm reliably. This short printing time is the result of the efficiency of the light engine. First, we show a comparison between the light efficiency for amplitude and phase encoding using a DMD as a spatial light modulator (SLM) [32] , [33] . We then present a pipeline to compute holograms for tomographic projections, where tiled holograms with PSF modification reduce speckle noise and increase contrast, and the Lee Hologram method allows to use of the DMD as a fast phase modulator [32] , [33] , [34] , [35] , [36] .",
