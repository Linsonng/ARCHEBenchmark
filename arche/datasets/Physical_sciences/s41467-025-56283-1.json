    "content": "Hyperuniform systems [1] , [2] are characterised by a vanishing density spectrum χ v ( q ) at low wavenumbers ( q ), setting them apart from ordinary liquids and disordered solids. Hyperuniformity, well-known in ordered systems like perfect crystals and quasicrystals, has been extensively studied in disordered systems over the past two decades, including plasmas [3] , polymers [4] , chicken retina cones [5] , colloidal suspensions [6] , jammed packings [2] , [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , and the early Universe [12] . Hyperuniform states can be classified into three classes based on the power-law scaling of the density spectrum χ v ( q → 0) ~ q α : class I with α > 1, class II with α = 1, and class III with 0 < α < 1 [1] . Disordered hyperuniform materials exhibit a combination of liquid-like isotropy and crystal-like vanishing density fluctuations at large length scales. These unique characteristics provide exceptional electronic, transport, and optical properties, such as isotropic photonic band gaps [1] , [13] . Hyperuniformity can emerge in a variety of contexts [1] . Some of these are associated with critical phenomena, such as jamming transitions [2] , [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] and absorbing transitions [6] , [10] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] . Others involve conserved fields, as seen in systems governed by electrostatic interactions [3] , [19] , hydrodynamic interactions [18] , [20] , [21] , centre-of-mass conservation [15] , and mass conservation [22] . Additionally, hyperuniformity can emerge from numerical procedures, such as collective-coordinate optimisation [23] and tessellation-based methods [24] . In this study, we investigate disordered sphere packings, which serve as essential model systems in physics, materials science, and biology [25] . Over two decades ago, Torquato and Stillinger [2] conjectured that a specific class of jammed packings, known as maximally random jammed (MRJ) packings, exhibit class II hyperuniformity characterised by a linear scaling in χ v ( q ). Due to critical slowing down when approaching the ideal MRJ state, as discussed in ref. [9] , system sizes are typically limited to several thousand particles in standard numerical simulations. Consequently, the linear scaling has only been confirmed for q /2 π > 0.1. Beyond this specific class of jammed packings, numerous studies [1] , [10] , [11] , [17] , [26] , [27] , [28] , [29] have explored the general relationship between hyperuniformity and the jamming transition. The jamming transition [30] occurs when the packing fraction ϕ exceeds a threshold known as the jamming point, ϕ J , at which rigidity emerges. For marginally jammed states formed by decompressing instantaneously quenched over-jammed packings or compressing ordinary liquids, the density spectrum shows linear scaling at intermediate wavenumber ranges (i.e. 0.08 < q /2 π < 0.4) [1] , [2] , [7] , [11] , [17] , [26] , [27] , [28] , [29] but eventually deviates at lower wavenumber ranges (i.e. q /2 π < 0.08). This deviation either saturates to a constant [27] , [28] or transitions to a new power-law scaling with α ≈ 0.25 [10] , [17] . This new hyperuniform scaling in the low- q region resembles the critical state observed in Manna-class absorbing phase transitions [10] , [14] , [17] , [31] . Wilken et al. [10] , [17] introduced a dynamical model, known as the biased random organisation (BRO) model, which exhibits active-absorbing phase transitions within the conserved-directed-percolation (Manna) universality class. At its critical point at maximum density, the BRO model not only recovers the random close packing (RCP) density ( \\({\\phi }_{c}^{\\max }\\approx {\\phi }_{{{{\\rm{RCP}}}}}\\approx 0.64\\) ) but also reproduces RCP’s hyperuniform density spectrum with α ≈ 0.25. This suggests that the RCP or jamming transition can be interpreted as an absorbing or dynamical phase transition [10] , [17] . However, the characteristics of marginally jammed states depend on preparation protocols [32] , [33] , [34] , with corresponding jamming points forming a jamming line [29] , [33] . Ozawa and collaborators [29] found that χ v ( q ) shows stronger deviations from linear hyperuniformity and becomes less hyperuniform for denser marginally jammed states produced by the swap Monte Carlo (SMC) method [35] . In addition to the ongoing debate about hyperuniformity and the jamming transition, it remains unclear whether hyperuniformity can persist in over-jammed states and what anomalous properties it might impart to the system. To address these critical issues, we first create hyperuniform over-jammed packings, referred to as hyperuniform glasses (HG), using an iterative algorithm that combines particle resizing with energy minimisation at a fixed packing fraction well above the jamming point. The density spectrum χ v ( q ) of HG exhibits ideal power-law scaling with α = 4, categorising them as class I hyperuniformity. For comparison, we produce conventional over-jammed packings, denoted as conventional glasses (CG), by quenching the equilibrium liquid state heated from HG. Subsequently, we obtain two marginally jammed states, decompressed from HG and CG, designated as JHG and JCG, with jamming points of ϕ = 0.666 and 0.648, respectively. While the χ v ( q ) in the range of 0.08 ≲ q /2 π ≲ 0.4 demonstrates linear scaling in JCG, it notably deviates in JHG. However, at lower wavenumbers, specifically q /2 π ≲ 0.08, the χ v ( q ) for both JCG and JHG eventually converges to a power-law scaling with α ≈ 0.25, which appears to be independent of the preparation protocols. Additionally, the contact-number structure factors, S Z ( q ), for both JCG and JHG also exhibit power-law scaling with α ≈ 2 in the same low wavenumber region, q /2 π ≲ 0.08. For both CG and HG in the over-jammed states, the contact number consistently exhibits normal fluctuations typical of disordered systems, regardless of whether the density itself is hyperuniform. Thus, density and contact-number fluctuations both exhibit hyperuniformity only at the jamming point but become independent as the system moves away from the critical point. This implies that special mechanical self-organisation at the jamming point leads to density and contact-number hyperuniformity, reflecting the essential difference in marginal stability between marginally jammed and conventional over-jammed states. Additionally, we demonstrate that HG exhibits exceptional stability across vibrational, kinetic, thermodynamic, and mechanical properties, contrasting sharply with the well-known marginal stability of marginally jammed states [30] , [36] , [37] and conventional over-jammed states [36] , [38] , even when marginally jammed states exhibit hyperuniformity. For example, the vibrational density of states exhibits a finite energy gap, indicating remarkable mechanical and kinetic stability. Moreover, the fictive temperature T f of HG is even lower than the Kauzmann temperature T K , which is determined from the diverging relaxation time fitted by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) equation. Our findings indicate the presence of a distinct, stable, disordered solid state that is more stable than a hypothetical ideal glass.",
