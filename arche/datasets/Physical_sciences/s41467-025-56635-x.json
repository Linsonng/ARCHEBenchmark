    "content": "Spinons are well-established quasiparticles in one-dimensional (1D) systems [1] , [2] , but their presence in dimensions higher than one remains a contentious topic [3] , [4] . In particular, spin-1/2 Heisenberg AFs on quasi-2D square lattices have been the subject of tremendous research effort in connection with high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in cuprates [5] . Despite the presence of Néel AF orders and the absence of apparent frustrations in these systems, earlier theoretical and experimental works have indicated that they can accommodate gapped spinon modes [6] , [7] , [8] . Indeed, the broad continua observed across many copper-based square-lattice AFs [7] , [9] , [10] , known as the ‘( π , 0) anomaly’, have been attributed to spinon excitations. Theoretically, their weights should increase in systems with enhanced long-range, multi-spin interactions competing with nearest-neighbor (NN) Heisenberg exchange ( J ) [11] , [12] , such as four-spin exchanges ( Q ) [8] , [13] , [14] , which can destabilize the Néel AF order in favor of more exotic phases. However, these parameters are difficult to control experimentally and the existence of spinons in square lattices remains unsettled. The realization of spin-orbit-entangled pseudospin-1/2 square-lattice AFs in iridates offers novel material platforms for exploring the problem in an uncharted parameter regime. The strong spin-orbit coupling in iridates imparts unique properties to their exchange interactions, ranging from a nearly isotropic Heisenberg to a bond-directional Ising-like exchange interaction [15] . This leads to a variety of theoretical predictions for novel quantum magnets, including Kitaev spin liquid in honeycomb compounds [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] , U (1) or Z 2 quantum spin liquid in hyperkagome compounds [20] , [21] . Similarly, in square-lattice iridates, enhanced higher-order spin interactions from spatially extended 5 d orbitals and increased virtual charge fluctuations due to a small charge gap [22] underlie the strong deviation of the single-layer (SL) Sr 2 IrO 4 from the NN Heisenberg model [23] and the exceptionally large spin gap in the double-layer (DL) Sr 3 Ir 2 O 7 [24] , [25] . Thus, the nature of exchange interactions in iridates varies widely even within the Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) series Sr n +1 Ir n O 3 n +1 . This allows for the possibility of heterointerfacing different types of magnetism in a superlattice, which may induce magnetic frustration through proximity coupling of symmetry-distinct orders [26] . In this article, we demonstrate a heterostructure-based strategy to frustrate the Néel AF order in square-lattice iridates. We use time-resolved resonant x-ray diffraction (RXD) to measure the degree of quantum fluctuations through the recovery dynamics of the AF order after its transient suppression by an optical pump, which significantly slows down with enhanced frustration. We use polarization-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and high-energy-resolution RIXS to reveal the absence of single magnons in most part of the Brillouin zone away from the immediate vicinity of the ordering wavevector. Instead, the spectra are dominated by isotropic continua, which provide compelling evidence for spinons in a square-lattice Heisenberg AF.",
