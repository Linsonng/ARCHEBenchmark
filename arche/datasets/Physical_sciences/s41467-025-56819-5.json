    "content": "Training and inference are two key processes in machine learning [1] , [2] . During training, synaptic devices need to adjust weights dynamically to generate a large number of resistive states. While, during inference, non-volatile storage of these weights is required to efficiently perform matrix multiplication [3] , [4] , [5] . Unlike machine learning which relies on electrical or optical signals alone, utilizing optical signals for training and converting them into non-volatile electrical signals for inference combines the strengths of both. This strategy leverages the wide bandwidth of optical signals and high-speed transmission capabilities, facilitating seamless integration with external circuits through the electrical output signals [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] . Non-volatile optoelectronic memories (NVOM) are the hardware foundation for this strategy, and they are expected to modulate a large number of non-volatile resistive states using ultra-short and ultra-dim light pulses, ensuring high accuracy, fast computing speed, and low energy consumption. Meanwhile, each resistive state should not decay after the removal of the light pulse. Floating-gate transistor (FGT) is an ideal device structure for NVOM [10] , [11] . Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered materials, with no surface dangling bonds, can reduce surface state generation, prevent carrier scattering, and thus enable fast device response, providing material base for FGTs [12] , [13] , [14] . However, 2D materials are usually used as channels or floating gates in FGTs to store carriers [15] , [16] , [17] . In this case, the synaptic weights could not be modulated through light without gate voltage assistance. The additional gate electrode poses challenges for large-scale integration and leads to increased electrical energy consumption and slow response speed [18] . Moreover, the device suffers from limited number of resistive states, which makes it difficult to construct neural networks with high training accuracy [19] . To solve these challenges, we propose using 2D photoconductive material as photosensitive control gate, instead of the commonly used metal control gate, to construct FGT. In this device, light plays a similar role to the gate voltage in traditional FGTs, and thus we call this device optical FGT (O-FGT). Besides excellent photoconductive properties, the 2D photoconductive material used in O-FGT should have low exciton binding energy ( E B ) and long exciton lifetime ( τ 0 ) [20] , [21] . The low E B and long τ 0 allow the separation of excitons by the electric potential difference generated inside photosensitive control gate without the assistance of additional gate voltage, and further writing into or erasing out of the floating gate layer. Unfortunately, most 2D materials have poor photoconductivity [22] , [23] . Although 2D Pb-based and Bi-based halide perovskites have excellent photoconductivity, the large E B and short τ 0 significantly impede effective exciton separation and transport [24] , [25] . Here, we synthesize a dielectric 2D photoconductive material, (NH 4 )BiI 3 , which has high density of states (DOS), low E B , and long τ 0 simultaneously. The O-FGT constructed with (NH 4 )BiI 3 as photosensitive control gate exhibits adjustable synaptic weights using light without the assistance of gate voltage and achieves non-volatile storage, showing no current decay after the removal of the light pulse, simultaneously meeting the demands of both training and inference processes. Moreover, it shows ultra-low training energy consumption (~5.25 fJ) to generate a non-volatile state and the largest resistive state numbers (up to 360) among the known non-volatile optoelectronic memories. An artificial neural network (ANN) is implemented by the on-chip trained weights of one-transistors-one-memory (1T1M) device array and achieves ~99% accuracy in nonlinear localization tasks. Moreover, the device array shows comparable performance of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in YOLOv8 while greatly reducing energy consumption.",
