    "content": "Phosphorus is remarkable for the structural diversity of its allotropes, but only a few of them are chemically stable and possess desired properties. The molecular forms of low nuclearity species are unstable, with white phosphorus P 4 self-igniting in air, and P 2 and P 6 species existing only in the gas phase at high temperature [1] , [2] . In contrast, polymeric red, violet and black phosphorus can be handled readily under ambient conditions. Phosphorene, a monolayer of black phosphorus, was recently demonstrated to be a semiconductor with a tuneable bandgap [3] , [4] . However, these sheets of black phosphorus are not stable towards a combination of moisture, oxygen and light. Another drawback is the high energy consumption during the synthesis of this allotrope from P 4 at 1.3 GPa and 200 °C [5] . Another important and stable allotrope is red phosphorus, which is more stable than black phosphorus with a wide bandgap of up to 2.4 eV [6] . Decreasing the bandgap of red phosphorus-based materials is a challenging task, and extensive theoretical and synthetic investigations have been conducted to develop new polymeric forms of phosphorus with improved stability and physiochemical properties. Von Schnering and Baudler have demonstrated [7] , [8] various types of clusters of phosphorus, including the structural elements of black phosphorus. Cis - and trans -linear chains, helical and double-helical chains containing [P 8 ] cages directly bound to each other have been predicted recently to be more stable than P 4 [9] . A phase-pure sample of fibrous phosphorus featuring parallel chains of P 8 building blocks [10] has been isolated by heating ultra-pure red phosphorus in the presence of CuCl 2 in vacuo [11] . Supramolecular chemistry can promote controllable polymerisation and stabilisation of phosphorus chains within the nanochannels of a porous host. Thus, CuI has been used to stabilise phosphorus nanorods in the form of (CuI) 8 P 12 and (CuI) 3 P 12 adducts [12] , as well as confining and stabilising anionic P 12 2– and P 14 2– species [13] . Activated carbons and carbon nanotubes can adsorb tetrahedral P 4 molecules [14] , with the latter also able to act as a host for the polymerisation of encapsulated white phosphorus molecules into single-stranded chains consisting of butterfly P 4 fragments [15] , [16] , [17] . Due to the amorphous nature of these materials, their structure determination remains elusive. A rich host–guest chemistry [18] , [19] , tuneable porosity, high crystallinity and potential stability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) make them ideal hosts for the inclusion of white phosphorus molecules, which might be further polymerised using visible light and analysed structurally by diffraction [20] , [21] . Moreover, the doping of MOFs with phosphorus chains of atomic width may improve the semiconducting properties of the resulting P–MOF composites. Here, we report the synthesis of a double-helical phosphorus chain comprising butterfly P 8 monomers stabilised in the helical channels of an indium-based MOF, MFM-300(In). The similarity between Raman spectra of bulk red phosphorus and the obtained adduct suggests the presence of such helical chains within the structure of amorphous red phosphorus, thus representing a comprehensive crystallographic study on the structural building units of the red phosphorus allotrope.",
