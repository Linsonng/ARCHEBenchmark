    "content": "Multiprincipal element alloys (MPEAs), also known as high entropy alloys, have garnered attention in recent years due to their excellent mechanical and physical properties stemming from their unique chemical complexity. Unlike conventional alloys, MPEAs are composed of multiple elements in high concentration. MPEAs comprising 3d transition metals have been widely explored due to their extraordinary strength and ductility at room [1] , [2] , [3] and cryogenic temperatures [4] owing to their low stacking fault energies and consequent additional deformation mechanisms [5] . In the context of additive manufacturing (AM), MPEAs offer a compelling avenue for the fabrication of high-performance components. Processing MPEAs via AM has led to improvements in properties such as strength [6] , [7] and corrosion resistance [8] compared to parts fabricated by conventional manufacturing methods such as casting. However, the AM processing of MPEAs presents challenges, just like in conventional alloys, particularly in material systems that solidify along preferred crystal orientations [9] . The high thermal gradients, rapid cooling rates, and partial remelting of previous layers can lead to the growth of columnar grains, resulting in highly textured microstructures. Previous investigations have highlighted the potential of composition as a parameter to alter microstructures in AM [10] , [11] . However, a deeper understanding of the composition-driven process-structure-property relationships in MPEAs will enable the strategic use of targeted compositions at specified locations to enhance the strength and performance of printed components [12] . Successful examples of alloy design strategies for grain refinement in AM include combining pre-existing alloys such as titanium alloys, nickel-based superalloys, and stainless steels to create new materials [13] , [14] , decorating the powder feedstock with nucleant particles [15] , and adding alloying elements to increase constitutional supercooling ahead of the solidification front [16] . In MPEAs, one effective method for changing the microstructure is to introduce a secondary phase by varying the composition of the alloy, such as adding aluminum, titanium, and niobium to MPEAs with 3d transition metals [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , [21] , [22] . Secondary phases such as body-centered cubic (bcc), Huesler-like ordered L2 1 phase, and Laves phase emerge to pin grain boundaries and break down epitaxial grain growth [23] . However, these additional elements may lead to the formation of brittle intermetallics, which can result in significant cracking during solidification as they cannot accommodate the high residual stresses in AM. In addition, the underlying mechanism by which phase transformation leads to grain refinement remains elusive due to challenges with measuring and interpreting the spatiotemporal evolution of microstructures and defects during and after solidification has finished [24] , [25] . The current study aims to illuminate a new grain refinement mechanism in MPEAs by combining thermodynamic modeling, operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, and multiscale microstructural evaluation to develop a comprehensive understanding of the intricate microstructural changes occurring during the AM process. We demonstrate an alloy design concept and adaptation for AM using a Fe 80-x Mn x Co 10 Cr 10 (at. %, x = 40, 45, and 50) MPEAs. These samples will henceforth be referred to by their Mn content, namely, Mn40, Mn45, and Mn50. In conventionally processed FeMnCoCr, decreasing the Mn content has shown a combination of exceptional strength and ductility due to the lowered stacking fault energy difference between the stable face-centered cubic (fcc) phase and deformation-induced hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase [1] . Instead, we increase the Mn content to destabilize the primary fcc phase during solidification to enable microstructure control in a direct energy deposition (DED) system where the microstructure generally tends to be more columnar due to its lower scanning speeds compared to powder-bed fusion (PBF) [10] . FeMnCoCr enables us to shed light on the complex relationship of composition, phase stability, process, microstructure, and properties to achieve a crack-free, refined microstructure in AM.",
