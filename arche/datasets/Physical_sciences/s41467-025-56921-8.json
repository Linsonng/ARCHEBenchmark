    "content": "Understanding and predicting phase transformations is one of the crucial tasks of condensed matter physics and materials science. Irradiation, which induces lattice atom displacement, is a common means of probing phase transformation dynamics, since irradiation can provide the driving force for overcoming the energy barrier between stable and metastable phases [1] . Study of irradiation-induced polymorphism has been used to elucidate transformation mechanisms in a broad range of both ionic-covalent [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] and metallic materials [7] , [8] . Many materials undergo multi-stage phase transformations under irradiation, such as the transition of pyrochlore- or spinel-structured complex oxides first to disordered defect-fluorite structures, then to amorphous structures as irradiation proceeds [3] , [4] , [9] . MAX phases show similar behavior in response to irradiation. These ternary layered carbides/nitrides, known as metallic ceramics [10] , [11] , [12] , have been proposed as candidate materials for wide-ranging applications due to their unique properties, such as nuclear fuel cladding materials and joint materials [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] . They also exhibit a unique multiphase transformation from an initial hex-phase (hexagonal structure) to a γ-phase (hexagonal close-packed structure), and then to a fcc-phase (face-centered cubic structure) under irradiation [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , [21] . However, almost all analyses to date were based on the initial phase or structure, and the role of intermediate phases in the transformation process has been rarely studied. It is a challenge to understand the mechanisms by only analyzing the initial phases. For example, antisite defect formation energy in the initial phases was considered as a criterion to assess the resistance to the irradiation-induced phase transformation, yet this approach cannot fully explain the phase behavior or offer a generalizable predictive capability, since it is restricted to the early stages of the phase transformation process, prior to the formation of the intermediate γ-phase [17] , [22] . For the material family of MAX phases (over 340 types), previous irradiation experiments were mostly performed under ex situ irradiation conditions, which does not provide direct observation of the evolving atomic structure as a function of irradiation damage level, and thus fails to describe the complete, multi-stage phase transformation pathway. In addition, prior analyses also mainly focused on the initial hexagonal phases [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] and provided only a phenomenological description of irradiation-induced phase behaviors [18] , [19] , [27] , [28] . No substantial theoretical investigation of compositional trends in the dynamics of these multi-stage phase transformations has been reported, thus far. Hence, there is a clear need for a comprehensive understanding of the multi-stage phase transformation behavior in this class of materials. In this work, we report an investigation of the distinct phase transformation behaviors of three representative MAX phases, M 2 AlC (M=Cr, V, Nb), under in situ ion irradiation with real-time TEM observation. The anomalous case of Cr 2 AlC is observed, which does not follow the common hex-γ-fcc phase transition pathway as in V 2 AlC and Nb 2 AlC. Instead, Cr 2 AlC follows a hex-γ-amorphous transition pathway, without forming the fcc-phase. Using ab initio calculations, we explain the compositional origin of these phase transformation dynamics. Unlike prior computational work which considered only the energetics of structural transitions from the initial hex-phase [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] , this improved description of phase energetics captures the key role of the intermediate γ-phase in mediating the radiation response. An atomic-scale mechanism for the observed phase behavior is developed through the quantitative description of energetics along the transformation pathway and the underlying characteristics associated with the lattice and electronic structures of the intermediate γ-phase. We ultimately develop a generalized rule for prediction of the extreme environment phase transition behaviors of MAX phases of varying composition based on atomic radius and electronegativity. This method can be potentially extended to similar complex ceramics that undergo multi-stage phase transformations.",
