    "content": "Twinning of tetrahedra to form decahedra or icosahedra with fivefold symmetry is common in multiply twinned particles (MTPs). Fivefold twinned structures in nanoparticles have attracted continuous attention in the field not only of crystal growth [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , but also of cluster physics [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , crystallography [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , physical chemistry [15] , [16] , surface science [17] , [18] , and materials [19] , [20] . For example, Wu et al. reported that the icosahedral Pt alloy catalysts have superior activity toward oxygen reduction reaction compared to single-crystalline octahedra, which may arise from strain-induced electronic effects [16] . Han et al. found that Au icosahedral particles show more efficient surface-enhanced Raman scattering properties compared to spherical particles with similar sizes [18] . The distinct physical and chemical properties of MTPs are largely due to their chemical sites and associated lattice-misfit strain, which makes the knowledge of their full atomic structures essential. Face-centered cubic (fcc) crystals, having co-planar twin planes enclosing an angle of 70.53° (close to 360°/5), can form fivefold twinned structures including decahedron and icosahedron. To fill the concomitant space gaps between two adjacent (111) faces of the fcc regular tetrahedron with an angle of 70.53°, internal distortion needs to be incorporated to form decahedral or icosahedral MTPs [21] , [22] , [23] , [24] . Different competing strain models including homogeneous and inhomogeneous strain models have been proposed mostly based on elastic theory to explain the internal distortion and space-filling mechanism. Homogeneous strain model [25] suggests the existence of simple linear displacement in crystal lattice. On the other hand, inhomogeneous strain distributions have been observed with evidence of dislocations [26] , [27] , [28] and disclinations [20] , [29] . In addition to the internal strain, the final crystallographic symmetry is further determined by a subtle balance between surface and volume contributions to the total energy of the MTPs [30] , [31] . The elastic strain energy resulting from the atomic distortion can be compensated by reducing surface energy through optimal surface atomic arrangements [31] . Ino and Marks proposed extra crystal planes on the classical decahedron models to reduce surface energy. They achieved the energy balance either by exposing more (100) faces [32] or introducing re-entrant planes on the twin boundaries [33] . Both models have been recently confirmed in core-shell decahedral MTPs, where extra high-index crystal planes at the corners or edges further reduce the surface energy [14] . During the growth of icosahedra, faulted islands and grooves have been observed [1] , [3] . These structures form curved surfaces that lower the surface energy and relieve strain [31] . Despite a number of experimental and computational studies have been done on the formation mechanisms [34] , [35] , stability [23] , [24] , [36] , [37] and lattice defects [20] , [21] , [22] of fivefold twinned structures, the 3D atomic structures and associated local strain of icosahedra are still long-standing problems because the embedded internal structures including distribution of dislocations or disclinations remain unclear due to their structural complexity and limitation of conventional projection imaging techniques. The high-resolution electron microscopy images of atomic columns or lattice fringes from the fivefold directions are commonly employed to elucidate the atomic structures of MTPs. Johnson et al. confirmed the presence of disclinations and inhomogeneous strain distribution with shear gradients through geometric phase analysis based on two-dimensional (2D) projection images [20] . Narayan et al. found the boundaries of fivefold diamond microcrystallites contain coherent twins with occasional presence of dislocations to accommodate the misfit [38] . Li et al. proposed oriented attachment of small crystal domains induces fivefold twins using in situ electron microscopy [4] . While these experimental observations are predominantly based on 2D projections, the internal structures were not obtained. Recent advances in the atomic resolution electron tomography (AET) [39] , [40] , [41] , [42] offer a method to visualize the internal atomic structures of nanomaterials in 3D and even in 4D. Chen et al. observed the 3D core structure of edge and screw dislocations releasing strain in Pt decahedral MTP [11] . More recently, Peltz et al. studied the transient 3D structures of a Pd MTP, in which a large number of defects have been revealed qualitatively including disordered regions present mostly on the particle surface [13] . However, although experimental studies show that the strains are inhomogeneous in fivefold MTPs, quantitative measurements of 3D inherent atomic misfit and strain were not obtained, further precluding a thorough understanding of the phenomenon. Here, by determining the 3D atomic coordinates of gold-palladium MTPs, we show that the 3D angular deficiency in fivefold twinned icosahedral nanoparticles (ICNPs) is compensated by the insertion of edge dislocations and amorphization of several tetrahedra. A geometrically fivefold face (C5 side) consistently corresponds to a less-ordered face (C5′ side), forming two structurally distinct hemispheres. The solid angles of disordered amorphous domains are significantly larger than those of the ideal fcc domains, relaxing a large amount of strain and filling up the angular defects. We also discover a two-sided heterogeneity in a variety of structural characteristics including local bond orientation order (BOO), bond length, distribution of dislocations, and solid angle and size of tetrahedra. The observations of Janus-like structural heterogeneity are corroborated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the atomic structures of Au nanoparticles after annealing in liquid–solid phase transitions. Our research has unveiled a strain model in which some tetrahedra on one side of the ICNP are transformed to disordered structures to release the intrinsic strain, while the rest of tetrahedra on the other side remain almost ideal fcc. This work provides insight into atomistic models for understanding the formation mechanisms of fivefold and icosahedral twinned structures.",
