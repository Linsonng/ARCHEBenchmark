    "content": "Plasma without a breakdown threshold can support an acceleration gradient six orders of magnitude higher than that in conventional accelerators [1] . When a driving laser propagates inside a gas-density plasma, its wakefield can form a well-controlled bubble structure, resulting in the successful acceleration of electrons to around 10 GeV on a decimetre scale [2] , [3] . For the acceleration of protons with a much larger mass-to-charge ratio, solid-density plasmas are usually utilized as they can support a stronger electric field [4] , [5] . The accelerated protons with ultralow transverse emittance and picosecond duration have been applied for the production of high-energy-density matter [6] , measurement of transient electromagnetic field [7] , and flash radiotherapy of cancer at an ultrahigh dose rate [8] . However, limitations, including the lack of a long acceleration structure [9] , deflection of protons by the self-generated magnetic field [10] , and dephasing of the fastest protons during acceleration [11] , lead to a proton energy below 100 MeV in experiments [12] , [13] , [14] except one very recent work reporting the generation of 150-MeV protons [15] . Improving the energy of laser-accelerated protons is thus essential for applications, especially for the instantaneous radiography of dense objects and clinical therapy of deep-seated tumours [16] . To increase the proton energy, a series of efforts has been made in the past two decades [1] . Among them, the utilization of structured targets has been intensively studied, and several effective designs have been demonstrated. A straightforward solution is modifying the target front surface to enhance the laser-plasma coupling, and different coating structures, including surface grating [17] , carbon nanotube foam [18] , and arrays of microwire [19] or microtube [20] , have been attempted. Another method is modulating the acceleration field in the target rear surface by adopting hydrogen-rich micro-dots [21] , hemispherical pits [22] , or helical coils [23] . Besides, a number of experiments have employed mass-limited targets to improve the proton quality, which can be roughly categorized into two schemes. The first utilizes isolated high-repetition targets, like microspheres [24] , [25] , [26] , and cryogenic hydrogen jets [27] , where protons are accelerated mainly via the mechanism of collisionless shock acceleration [24] or Coulomb explosion [25] , [26] . The second scheme uses foils with a reduced transverse size to enhance the target normal sheath acceleration (TNSA) of protons, since the laterally spreading electrons would be reflected around the foil edges [28] , [29] and reaccelerated to higher energies if a sub-picosecond driving laser [10] , [30] , [31] , [32] , [33] , [34] was employed. Several experiments have also tried a femtosecond driving laser with a relatively low power of less than 200 TW, demonstrating a robust enhancement of proton energy [35] , [36] , [37] . The major challenge in further improving the proton energy by irradiating a petawatt femtosecond laser on structured targets is to preserve the nano- or micro-structures before the arrival of the main pulse. High temporal contrast of laser is a prerequisite for such experiments since the intensity of prepulse should be suppressed below the damage threshold of the targets, which is relatively low due to the structures [38] . Another difficulty is to maintain an excellent laser pointing accuracy within a few microns [28] , which is crucial to precisely align the focal spot on the structures of targets. Moreover, since the peak intensity of a multi-petawatt laser can be orders of magnitude higher than that of terawatt pulses, proton acceleration may occur via a novel and complex mechanism, and a proper understanding of the acceleration process is critical for the optimization of laser parameters and the design of target structures. In this article, we demonstrate an enhanced acceleration of protons from a structured nanometre-thick polymer foil driven by a multi-petawatt femtosecond laser. The temporal contrast and pointing stability of the petawatt laser were well controlled, and the transverse shape of the polymer foils was tailored with a 100-kHz, μJ femtosecond laser. From a 100-nm-thick, 30-μm-wide foil, 110-MeV protons were successfully measured by several detection methods and unambiguously confirmed by the CR-39 plate in a stack detector. With the help of two- and three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we revealed that such energetic protons were accelerated by a hybrid mechanism of radiation pressure and Coulomb repulsion, the latter of which was enhanced in laser-tailored foils by suppressing the conduction of cold electrons. Our experimental result, thus, clearly demonstrated the enhancement of proton energy by employing conduction-restricted nanometre targets. Furthermore, our work indicates that the current technology is ready to support the desired interaction of a petawatt femtosecond driving laser with structured foils, and further improving the proton quality can be realized by employing well-designed targets with controllable acceleration structures.",
