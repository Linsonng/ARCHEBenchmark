    "content": "Developing carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies is crucial for managing anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions while providing sources of sustainable chemicals and fuels. However, direct air capture is energy-intensive and costly [1] , [2] . In comparison, dissolved inorganic carbon in seawater has a bicarbonate molarity that is ~ 140 times higher than the 420 ppm of atmospheric CO 2 . Furthermore, seawater is a natural carbon sink of net ~ 0.4 giga-ton CO 2 per year via the flux exchange between the seawater and atmosphere, potentially supporting trillion-ton-scale CO 2 capture, utilization, and sequestration via engineering solutions [3] , [4] . In particular, the conversion of dissolved carbon in seawater into carbon-based fuels or chemical products can be entirely powered by sunlight using photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices. Such solar-powered chemical devices, floating on the ocean, could utilize ocean current, tidal energy, and sunlight to generate dissolved CO 2 on demand via bicarbonate acidification, i.e., HCO 3 − + H + → CO 2 (aq) + H 2 O. Then, the CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R) reaction converts the dissolved CO 2 , i.e., CO 2 (aq), to gaseous carbon products, such as CO or C 2 H 4 , for subsequent synthesis of liquid fuels or chemicals. These PEC devices employ pairs of photoanodes and photocathodes designed to drive water oxidation and fuel-forming CO 2 R reactions, respectively, with sunlight as the only energy inputs [5] , [6] , [7] . In a stepwise fashion, CO 2 can be captured from dissolved carbon in seawater as the carbon source for the subsequent PEC CO 2 R conversion [8] , [9] . Despite established technology, stepwise capture and conversion have rarely been demonstrated due to the challenges mentioned below. Alternatively, an integrated PEC process for the direct utilization of dissolved carbon for solar fuel production is expected to consume much less energy and be more economically viable than the stepwise approach such as PV-driven CO 2 capture and CO 2 electrolysis. Figure 1a illustrates a conventional PEC device configuration for unbiased CO 2 reduction and water oxidation, which operates in static electrolytes. In this design, the anodes and cathodes are arranged back-to-back in a tandem configuration [10] , [11] , which maximizes light absorption. Fuel-forming reactions, including CO 2 reduction and H 2 evolution, proceed at the cathode, and water oxidation reactions proceed at the anode. Because the electrolyte of the PEC device is static, diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism, subsequently generating an ionic current that is carried with H + , HCO 3 − , and other major ionic species. As shown in Fig. 1c , acid-base reactions occur during the diffusional transport of CO 2 (aq), H + , and HCO 3 − . The pH gradient, ion transport, and acid-base buffer reactions between the anodes and cathodes are the major transport losses. Seawater, with its ionic strength of ~ 0.7 M, is a good ionic conductor [12] , [13] , which means the electrolyte resistance has minimal contribution to the transport losses under solar illumination. CO 2 reduction or H 2 evolution consumes H + , and net produces OH − . The pH gradient typically contributes to notable transport loss in the PEC device. Diffusion-dominant transport creates a pH gradient in the buffered electrolyte (Fig. 1c), e.g ., from 10 to 4, for a current density of 0.5 mA/cm 2 in a static 2 mM HCO 3 − buffer electrolyte, which leads to a higher pH at the cathode and reducing local CO 2 (aq). The pH difference between the cathodes and anodes adds to the device’s potential loss, which can be as high as 500 mV, due to pH-dependent thermodynamic potentials [14] , [15] . Because of this, the solar-to-fuel (STF) conversion efficiency for CO 2 reduction, or water splitting broadly, is low: e.g., photoabsorbers of SrTiO 3 /BiVO 4 , amorphous-Si/BiVO 4 , and perovskite/BiVO 4 (with BiVO 4 the photocurrent-limiting absorber) have achieved STF efficiency of 0.08% [16] , 0.43% [17] , and 0.63% [18] respectively.

The arrows in Fig. 1d represent CO 2 flux, and the light green area represents the spatial distribution of CO 2 produced at the anode underflow. The pH ranges in ( c and d ) are derived from the pH map and modeling in Fig. 5 . Full size image The conventional diffusion transport of H + and HCO 3 − in a pH-neutral and buffered electrolyte leads to a high pH near the CO 2 R cathodes. As shown in Fig. 1c , CO 2 (aq) is constantly consumed by OH − near the cathode. As a result, there is insufficient reactant for PEC CO 2 R. This continuous CO 2 -OH − reaction (Fig. 1c ) depletes the CO 2 (aq) concentration to near zero, eliminating selectivity for carbon products such as CO and C 2 H 4 . Thus, another challenge of utilizing seawater arises from the low concentration of dissolved carbon species including HCO 3 - and CO 2 (aq). Among these species, HCO 3 − is not considered an active species during (photo-)electrochemical CO 2 reduction. However, seawater contains only 2.3 mM bicarbonate, and the concentration of electrochemically active CO 2 (aq) species is near zero. To utilize seawater for liquid solar fuel production, one typically takes a stepwise approach of first acidifying seawater to convert the HCO 3 − to pure CO 2 and then bubbling the pure CO 2 continuously into a conventional PEC device to increase the reactant concentrations. To improve the selectivity for carbon products, it is necessary to ensure sufficient CO 2 (aq) reactants by constantly bubbling CO 2 gas. However, this approach is costly and is limited by low energy and carbon utilization efficiency (continuous CO 2 bubbling and CO 2 -OH - reaction), and thus not economically viable. In addition, it is impractical to scale such CO 2 bubbling schemes for large-area PEC reactors situated on the ocean. Overall, the combined challenge in reaction engineering and CO 2 R catalysis motivates new ways of effectively managing diffusion-based transport losses and performance degradation due to the depletion of CO 2 (aq) local to photocathodes. Thus far, reported PEC devices that leverage flowing seawater with 2.3 mM bicarbonate and without CO 2 bubbling remain largely unexplored. In this case, flow replaces diffusion to dominate the transport. Besides, the complex multi-species composition and chemical equilibrium of seawater is a notable challenge for direct ocean CO 2 capture and conversion, including major mineral species, i.e., Na + , Cl − , Mg 2+ , and Ca 2+ [8] , [19] , and organic carbon and microbial species. Chemical selective coatings are needed to permeate active reactants and prevent catalyst poisoning by minerals or other impurities in seawater [20] . For proof-of-concept, simulated seawater was used. We demonstrate an understudied regime of molecular flux catalysis in which CO 2 (aq) reactants continuously flow to the catalysts within a boundary layer flow (Fig. 1 b and d ). This boundary layer flow is generated by a custom-designed and 3D-printed PEC device, which has tandem pairs of BiVO 4 photoanodes to Si photocathodes that are arranged in parallel (Fig. 1b ). PEC CO 2 R catalysis coupled with the boundary flow transport enables the conversion of the naturally low concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon found in seawater (2.3 mM HCO 3 − ) to a flux of CO 2 (aq) (Fig. 1d ). In this work, we make four parallel configurations for the Fig. 1b design, which in practice can be repeated periodically to achieve scaled-up, solar-driven, direct ocean CO 2 conversion. The boundary-layer shear flow confines a continuous flux of CO 2 (aq) molecules near the surface from the photoanode to the photocathode. The BiVO 4 photoanode generates H + thus acidifying HCO 3 − in flowing seawater under sunlight. The flow also prevents the out-diffusion of the CO 2 (aq) to the bulk seawater, increasing the transport flux of CO 2 (aq) and H + and simultaneously reducing the CO 2 (aq)’s residence time to achieve its efficient utilization at each photocathode downstream. Notably, the flow energy can be readily harvested from tidal waves and ocean currents, making such a boundary layer flow scheme possible. The CO 2 (aq) flux, in situ, generated by the BiVO 4 photoanode, arrives at the catalyst of the Si photocathode and then gets converted to gaseous CO products which accumulate at the device headspace. Besides the CO 2 (aq) flux, the H + flux is enhanced by the flow. This boundary layer flow reduces the pH gradient (supported by Fig. 5 data) and other concentration-limited transport losses (supported by Fig. 6 simulation) to improve PEC device efficiency of CO 2 reduction, water splitting, and other fuel-forming photocatalysis broadly. Compared to conventional static PEC devices, the STF efficiency of our flow device increased from 0.4% to 0.71%, which is the highest efficiency among reported BiVO 4 -based CO 2 -reduction devices. This molecular flux approach tunes the CO 2 R catalytic selectivity via flow velocities. We also conducted modeling and numerical simulations to quantify the effect of flow vectors on the selectivity and rates of the PEC device. According to the simulation and experimental outcome, this molecular flux catalysis approach through boundary layer flow drastically increased the selectivity of carbon-based products such as CO from 3% to 21%—approaching the theoretical limit of utilizing seawater under the solar flux, whereas conventional static device (Fig. 1c ) requires constant bubbling of CO 2 gas to achieve a comparable selectivity level. Resources such as seawater, air, and waste streams are typically low in the active species of CO 2 (aq) but high in bicarbonates and carbonates due to their much higher solubility. This molecular flux catalysis concept has the potential to enable the solar-driven direct conversion of low-concentration reactants or improve the utilization efficiency of dilute reactants.",
