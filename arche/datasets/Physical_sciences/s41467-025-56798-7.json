    "content": "As an important functional material, piezoceramics, represented by lead zirconate titanate {(Pb(Zr, Ti)O 3 , PZT)}, have been widely used in many vital technical applications such as ultra-precision actuators, sensors, and transducers [1] , [2] . In recent years, the rapid development of technology demands for piezoceramics with better overall performance to meet harsh usage conditions [3] , [4] . In particular, piezoelectric devices, such as sensors and actuators, require piezoceramics possessing excellent piezoelectric properties and good temperature stability, with the purpose of ensuring sensitivity within their operating temperature range and providing reliable and stable sensing outputs. However, the trade-off relationship between piezoelectricity and its temperature stability poses a significant challenge that remains unresolved. Therefore, developing piezoceramics with both satisfactory properties has become one of the most cutting-edge tasks in piezo/ferroelectrics. The trade-off relationship between two properties stems from their different contributions. Generally, the high piezoelectricity is usually obtained by introducing structural instability, while the high temperature stability prefers a stable structure. Therefore, these previously reported strategies (e.g., conducting donor doping, introducing relaxor end members, and designing local heterogeneous structures) used for introducing structural instability inevitably decrease the Curie temperature ( T C ) that dictates workable temperature range [5] , [6] , [7] . Intriguingly, even though the complex preparation process and high cost, the texturing method did significantly enhance both piezoelectricity and temperature stability even without increasing the T C , which sheds the light for achieving both high properties. The results showed that the high texturing degree and the large grain size make the domain switching more sufficiently and the degree of poling more saturated in the textured piezoceramics, resulting in the both stable phase structure and domain configurations [8] , [9] , [10] . By contrast, the random piezoceramics prepared by the conventional solid-state sintering method usually exhibit the inferior degree of poling and the insufficient domain switching due to the randomly-distributed orientation of both crystal cells and domains and the relatively small grain size. In addition to the above, a large number of pores and oxygen vacancies will be generated in random PZT-based ceramics due to the high sintering temperature (~1200 °C) and the volatilization of Pb element. The existence of pores reduces the density and electric breakdown strength ( E b ), and the oxygen vacancies construct complex dipole defects (e.g., V“ Pb -V •• O ), both of which hinder the saturated poling and domain switching. In particular, the dipole defects not only pin the room-temperature domain switching but also show a de-pinning at high temperature due to the enhanced migration, worsening both piezoelectricity and temperature stability. Conversely, if one can effectively eliminate the pores and reduce the content of oxygen vacancies in PZT-based ceramics, both high piezoelectricity and improved temperature stability are highly anticipated. Moreover, it is desirable that the proposed new strategy is more economical and practical than the texturing method. Inspired by the foregoing analysis and the thermodynamic theory, we proposed a synergistic design, namely combining phase boundary engineering and process engineering, to simultaneously boost piezoelectricity and temperature stability and validated it in Pb 0.92 Ba 0.08 [Zr 0.50+ x Ti 0.48- x (Nb 0.5 Sb 0.5 ) 0.02 ]O 3 ( x = 0–0.8) (abbreviated to PBZTNS- x ) ceramics, as schemed in Fig. 1 . For the Strategy 1 (i.e., the phase boundary engineering), we elaborately adjusted the Zr/Ti ratio to establish the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in PBZTNS- x ceramics. The flattened Landau energy profile at the MPB and the nanoscale multi-phase coexistence endow PBZTNS- x ceramics with enhanced dielectric response, consequently boosting the piezoelectricity (Fig. 1a ). For the Strategy 2 (i.e., the process engineering), based on the optimal composition selected by the Strategy 1, we employed the tape casting, lamination, and hot pressing techniques to achieve a denser microstructure and reduce the PbO volatilization and the content of oxygen vacancies, thereby improving the temperature stability. Fig. 1: Schematic diagrams of our proposed combined strategy and its expected effect. a For the phase boundary engineering, regulating the Zr/Ti ratio makes the ceramics approach the MPB, which lowers the Landau energy barrier of different ferroelectric phases and consequently promotes the dielectric and piezoelectric properties. R and T are the abbreviations of rhombohedral (R) and tetragonal (T) phases, respectively. P R and P T represent the spontaneous polarization of R and T phases, respectively. b For the process engineering, the tape casting, lamination, and hot isostatic pressing are applied to the well-designed MPB-featured composition selected by the Strategy 1. The process engineering significantly reduces the content of pores and oxygen vacancies, thereby further improving piezoelectric properties but boosting the temperature stability. c Expected three effects from the combined strategy. d Alleviating the trade-off relationship between piezoelectricity and its temperature stability by the combined strategy. e Advantages of our strategy. Full size image We’d like to emphasize the distinctions between previous literatures and our work. Most literatures employed one of these process techniques and obtained the limited enhancement in piezo/ferroelectric properties. For example, the hot-press sintering can improve the density and piezo/ferroelectric properties moderately [11] , [12] , [13] . The tape casting can improve the microstructure of piezoceramics and is widely used for fabricating ultra-thin ceramics, multilayer ceramics, and textured ceramics [14] , [15] . But it still hardly improves piezoelectric properties and the temperature stability simultaneously for an individual composition without adding texturing templates [16] , [17] . Here, based on the Strategy 1, we combined three process techniques together to achieve this goal by significantly improving the density and reducing the PbO volatilization, which was rarely reported. Encouragingly, we achieved the simultaneous enhancement of piezoelectricity and temperature stability through the synergetic design and discussed the physical origin from both intrinsic and extrinsic contributions.",
