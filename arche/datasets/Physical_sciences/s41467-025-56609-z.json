    "content": "Gas sensors, enhancing our olfactory capabilities, are prized for their reliability and sensitivity, with critical roles in air quality [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , medical analysis [5] , [6] , [7] , and industrial monitoring [8] , [9] , [10] . Among gas sensors, the chemiresistive sensors are favored due to their small size, ease of manufacturing, simple operation, and their cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, the principle that enables chemiresistive sensors to detect gases is based on alterations of resistance in different gaseous environments, which makes them vulnerable to temperature changes [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] . Such variations will cause a drift in the baseline resistance of R 0 , thereby compromising the precision of the sensor. Incorporating temperature compensation components into the sensor can mitigate issues arising from temperature variations [15] , [16] . However, this approach typically requires extra circuitry or complex algorithms, rasing cost of the overall device. Incorporating a self-tuning technique into a single material to achieve temperature compensated detection represents a formidable challenge. Ratiometry measurement is an analytical technique that enhances measurement precision by comparing the ratio of signal intensities from two or more distinct signals [17] , [18] , [19] . This approach effectively reduces errors due to varying experimental conditions. Therefore, incorporating ratiometry measurement into gas-sensitive sensors presents a promising strategy to overcome the challenge of device accuracy loss due to baseline drift from temperature changes. Indeed, discovering a suitable reference factor that neutralizes baseline drift is essential for the ratiometric-gas sensor. In this regard, we present a ratiometric approach that cleverly employs the photoelectric response (R ph ) of a material as an internal reference to its gas-sensitive response (R gas ). This innovative strategy relies on the synthesis of a material that exhibits high activity to both light of particular wavelength and target gaseous molecules, traditionally a challenging task given the contrasting design principles of gas and light sensing materials. Gas sensors typically depend on defects for sensing activity [20] , [21] , [22] , [23] , whereas light sensors are designed to minimize defects to improve photoelectric performance [24] , [25] , [26] , [27] . A thorough comprehension to harmonize the competing demands of gas sensing and photoelectric functionality in one material is still out of reach. Emerging as a promising class of gas sensing materials, organic-inorganic hybrid covalent superlattice materials [28] , [29] are poised to redefine the balance between gas sensitivity and photoelectric performance. This is due to: (1) The distinctive multi-quantum well structure of the superlattice, which gives rise to quantum confinement effects, and amplifies the photoelectric response [30] , [31] , [32] , [33] , [34] , [35] . (2) The surface of the organic-inorganic hybrid covalent superlattice is covered with long-range ordered functional groups, which can replace the defects of traditional materials, provide abundant active sites for gas detection, and significantly improve the sensitivity of the gas sensor [36] . Thus, organic-inorganic hybrid covalent superlattices are anticipated to deliver both robust photoelectric and gas sensing responses. Consequently, the application of this material for ratiometric-gas sensing could mitigate temperature-dependent interference. Here, we introduce an organic-inorganic hybrid covalent superlattice material AgBDT (BDT = 1,4-benzenedithiol), which functions as a high-efficiency ratiometric gas sensing material. The two-dimensional continuous inorganic [AgS] n layers are interspersed by organic benzene rings, creating a distinctive multi-quantum well structure that lays the platform for an enhanced photoelectric response. The surface of AgBDT covered with long range ordered sulfhydryl functional groups endows it with exceptional sensitivity to nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). Specifically, NO 2 can be stably adsorbed on AgBDT nanosheets through Lewis acid-base interaction and hydrogen bonding with thiol groups. For the strong electron-withdrawing ability of NO 2 , electrons can be extracted from AgBDT and transferred to NO 2 , leading to a resistivity change of AgBDT. Leveraging its superior photoelectric and gas sensitivity properties, a ratiometric approach was formulated to gas sensing analysis (Fig. 1 ). This method shows that the ratio values are highly responsive to changes in gas concentration indicating the potential of NO 2 gas detecting capability of AgBDT. The detection limit of ratiometric gas sensor is 3.06 ppb. Notably, this ratiometric gas sensing is impervious to operational temperature fluctuations, achieving a substantial reduction in the coefficient of variation (CV) value from 21.81% to 7.81%, greatly refining the precision of gas detection (limit of detection, LOD).
