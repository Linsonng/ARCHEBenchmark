    "content": "Quantum metrology’s efficiency is fundamentally influenced by two critical factors: the Heisenberg limit, which defines how accuracy scales with quantum resources, and the coefficients of this scaling. While a variety of quantum metrology strategies [1] , [2] , [3] successfully adhere to the Heisenberg scaling, the real challenge lies in achieving or even addressing optimality in the scaling coefficients with realistic constraints. This aspect is particularly vital for applications in quantum error correction, where achieving fault-tolerant thresholds demands exceptionally high accuracy in quantum gate characterization. The necessity for deep circuitry, a significant hurdle in practical applications, stems directly from the lack of optimality in these scaling coefficients. This inefficiency is compounded by the challenges of finite coherence times and the amplification of drift errors from low-frequency noise or control fluctuations. Therefore, current quantum metrology protocols, limited to accuracy levels between 10 −2 and 10 −3 radians [2] , [3] for estimating gate angles, often fall short of the accuracy ( ~ 10 −4 ) needed to verify the crossing of fault-tolerant error threshold for quantum error correction and other near-term quantum applications. In quantum metrology for gate calibration, two primary approaches are used: robust phase estimation (RPE) and randomized benchmarking. RPE, along with its extensions like Floquet calibration, can achieve the Heisenberg limit under ideal conditions and are robust against state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors across both single and multi-qubit gates [1] , [2] , [3] . However, its practical implementation is limited by the need for deep circuits and resource-intensive, iterative black-box optimizations to ensure accurate calibration. Moreover, its precision drops to between 10 −1 and 10 −2 radians when dealing with the time-dependent drifts common in superconducting qubit systems. Though recent progress [4] , [5] refine the multiplicative overhead of RPE cost, they focus on the asymptotic regime rather than physically short-depth and noise-robust implementation. Meanwhile, the randomized benchmarking approach, although general, forgoes Heisenberg scaling. It also requires extensive circuit depth to accurately estimate parameters and lacks sensitivity to coherent rotation errors [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] . As a result, these prevalent quantum metrology techniques have not yet achieved optimal performance in practice for learning two-qubit gates. The effectiveness of a quantum metrology scheme can be assessed by the fundamental limits set by both classical and quantum Cramér-Rao bounds [10] , [11] . To meet the classical Cramér-Rao bounds, the inference subroutines that process measurements to estimate quantum gate parameters must be optimal. Similarly, to achieve the quantum Cramér-Rao bounds, the quantum measurement schemes, characterized by any Positive-Operator-Valued Measurements, must also be optimal [11] . Realizing optimality in both aspects requires refining classical post-processing techniques and the quantum circuit designs used in quantum gate calibration. In this work, we show that the RPE-based multi-parameter phase estimation method requires an additional phase-matching condition: the diagonal elements of the gates must share the same phase. If this condition is violated, the RPE-based method will fail to achieve both Heisenberg scaling and the classical Cramér-Rao bounds when there’s more than one phase to learn, even in the absence of quantum noise. In this work, we propose a metrology protocol that is, by design, robust against realistic time-dependent errors and only requires shallow ( < 10) circuits to achieve up to two orders of magnitudes of improvement over existing methods in the precision of gate-parameter estimates.",
