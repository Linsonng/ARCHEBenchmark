    "content": "Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, as exemplified by transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), have gradually delivered their potential to ease the significant challenges silicon integrated circuits encounter, that is, increasingly scaled size, heat, and memory walls [1] , [2] , [3] . Performances of both field-effect transistors (FETs) and memory devices can be boosted by leveraging 2D semiconductors’ characteristics, mainly including the atomic-scale thickness allowing exceptional electrostatic control and the dangling-bond-free surface with van der Waals (vdW) interactions responsible for the Lego-type integration [4] . Recently, all-in-one perceptual, memory and computational fusing in 2D devices have achieved tremendous success by creating technologies beyond von Neumann architecture, enabling in-sensor/memory computing for, e.g., image and acoustic pattern recognition and processing [1] , [5] , [6] . The vdW surface of 2D semiconductors, however, also leads to one critical challenge: integrating high-quality, high- k dielectrics as silicon did. For conventional amorphous high- k dielectrics, including hafnium oxide (HfO 2 ) and aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ), the absence of dangling bonds on 2D surfaces results in poor nucleation during the direct deposition methods such as atomic layer deposition (ALD), leading to suboptimal interface quality characterized by increased defects and undesirable doping to TMDs layers [7] . Thus, a buffer/seeding layer had to be performed first for ALD process [8] , [9] . CaF 2 epitaxially grown also by the gas-to-solid method has been demonstrated as excellent dielectrics for the back-gate configuration [10] . On the other side, by using the transfer technique, one can feasibly separate the fabrication and integration of dielectrics, loosening restrictions in dielectric elements and synthesis temperatures but asking for its transferrable feature [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] . For instance, single-crystal perovskite strontium titanium oxide (SrTiO 3 ), which holds a high static permittivity, can be first fabricated on sacrificial layers by pulsed laser deposition and then transferred as a freestanding flake to be incorporated into TMDs devices [17] , [18] . More importantly, in these devices, the omnipresent nanogap between TMDs and transferred oxides denies physical contact with the channel materials and also suppresses the gate leakage currents, allowing metal oxides with moderate bandgaps (3.3 eV for SrTiO 3 , and 3.8 eV for Sr 2 Nb 3 O 10 )) as good dielectrics that’s somewhat counterintuitive [17] , [18] , [19] . In the context of all-in-one in-sensor computing in 2D devices, one will expect that one certain layer in heterostructures is a sensing layer, for example, sensitively responsible to external stimuli (such as optical, electrical, and thermal ones) and effectively transferring this signal to neighboring layers, or even a multifunctional layer to reduce the layer number and simply the structure [20] . Deeply engineering the dielectric layer by rendering it multifunctional (beyond dielectric) is worth exploring [21] . When used as a component in 2D devices, the traditional dielectrics prepared by the gas-to-solid method are limited in material types and functions because of either the restricted gaseous precursors or the transferable prerequisite. On a parallel front, metal oxides obtained from the liquid-to-solid approach, i.e., the wet chemistry, are low-cost, massively prepared, and, more importantly, versatile in category and function, being widely used in thin-film electronics, including displays and sensors, and multi-energy areas like capacitors and batteries [22] , [23] . Merging two broad trajectories in separate fields, solution-processed metal oxides as dielectrics in 2D devices, remains an unexplored regime, and it can in principle offer more possibilities and candidates for advanced 2D electronics if the resulting metal oxides are compatible with 2D technology, for example, being able to be transferred and vdW integrated to form heterostructures. In this work, we report a wet-chemistry-derived method to unprecedentedly prepare amorphous copper calcium titanate (CCTO), a perovskite-type complex oxide, which can be transferred and further incorporated into 2D devices. Benefiting from its superior dielectric properties and the nanogap between transferred oxides and 2D semiconductors, CCTO/TMDs devices exhibit a subthreshold swing (SS) of 67 mV dec −1 and ultra-small hysteresis (~1 mV/(MV cm −1 ), corroborating a high-quality CCTO-2D materials interface. Furthermore, utilizing the optical properties of CCTO, in a simple FET device, optically writing and electrically erasing the floating gate are achieved, leading to a reconfigurable logic-in-sensor operation.",
