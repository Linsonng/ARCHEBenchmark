    "content": "The photoinduced semiconductor-to-metal transition (PSMT) has demonstrated significant potential in various applications, such as information storage, sensing, optoelectronics, optical switches, and so on [1] , [2] , [3] . In the realm of fundamental science, the PSMT reflects photodynamic mechanisms, photoinduced excitations and transition processes, and the relationship between material electronic and atomic structures [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] . In most cases, the PSMTs are just temporary and disappear as the irradiation is switched off [10] . In rare cases, the transition can be sustained [3] , usually by a conversion between a material’s crystalline and amorphous forms. PSMTs can induce changes in atomic structures, e.g., Peierls distortion in TiSe 2 and VO 2 [11] , [12] , or just alter the electronic structures [13] . So far, evidence for these phase transitions has been primarily based on conductivity variations, diffraction spectra, or theoretical simulations [14] , [15] , [16] . A direct real-space proof at the atomic or molecular scale remains absent. Moreover, all of the reported PSMTs occurred between two structural phases of the same material [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] . There has been no precedent for PSMTs between two different materials. Surface reconstruction refers to structural changes in the surface lateral atomic arrangement, likely to be accompanied by the varied vertical interlayer spacing and surface dipole [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , [21] . This transformation significantly affects the chemical and physical nature of materials, playing a vital role in catalysis, sensing, surface engineering, device design, and biomedical technologies [22] , [23] , [24] , [25] . Regulating and understanding surface reconstruction is thus critical for both fundamental and applied research. Surface reconstruction can be triggered through a variety of approaches, e.g., surface cleaning, cleavage, molecule adsorption, and surface reactions [26] , [27] , [28] . Photoinduced surface reconstruction is scarcely reported, despite its high controllability, remote operability, and possible interoperability with other photo-related techniques. In all reported cases, the chemical composition of the surface layers remains essentially unchanged. Copper selenide (Cu 2 Se) is an intrinsic semiconductor [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] . Its thin flake is known as a typical two-dimensional (2D) transition metal chalcogenide. The interaction of photons with 2D materials has sparked great interest due to their unique optical and photoelectrical properties, as well as their immense potential in optoelectronic sensing, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices [33] , [34] , [35] , [36] , [37] , [38] , [39] . Herein, we present atomic-scale evidence for a photoinduced transition from a Cu 2 Se layer on top of Cu(111) to the single-atomic Cu layer (Fig. 1 ). The Cu 2 Se single-atomic layer is produced by selenization of the Cu(111) surface in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), forming a striped Moiré pattern. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM and STS) with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that light irradiation can trigger a dramatic “face changing” of the surface, transforming it from the semiconducting Cu 2 Se layer into a close-packed Cu layer by sinking the Se atoms to the subsurface, creating a new Cu 2 Se sublayer, and lifting partial subsurface Cu atoms to the outermost layer. Upon thermal activation, the transition can be reversed to the original Cu 2 Se surface via segregation. The photoinduced transition of the surface into an electronically excited state is crucial, as the calculated Cu 2 Se-to-Cu transition barrier is significantly lower in the excited state than in the ground state. This work proposes an example of PSMT between two distinct materials. The interlayer atom exchange switches the surface layer from semiconducting to metallic. The findings shed fresh light on photoinduced surface reconstruction, with potential applications in photodetectors, catalysis, and, most notably, in the development of innovative materials with unique functions. Fig. 1: Schematic illustration of the photoinduced Cu 2 Se-to-Cu surface transition on Cu(111). The Cu 2 Se single layer is fabricated on Cu(111) by surface selenization, with the Se atoms, Cu atoms in the Cu 2 Se layer, and Cu atoms in all other layers colored orange, blue, and light blue, respectively. Upon light illumination, Se atoms sink to the sublayer, forming a new layer of Cu 2 Se there, while subsurface Cu atoms are lifted to the outermost surface. As a result, the surface reconstructs into a close-packed Cu layer. The photoinduced electronically excited state plays a crucial role in the semiconductor-to-metal transition. The transition is reversible upon thermal activation, reinstating the Cu 2 Se surface layer. Full size image",
