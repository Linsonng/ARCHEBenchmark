    "content": "Since the discovery of ferroelectrics in Rochelle salt in the 1920s [1] , ferroelectric materials have garnered considerable attention due to their unique structural properties at the unit cell level for various applications. The symmetry-breaking nature of the electrostatic boundary condition, which generates a permanent depolarization field confers ferroelectrics with unique physical properties. Presently, studies on ferroelectrics mainly fall into two categories. One focuses on polarization variation, such as ferroelectric memories [2] , [3] , negative capacitance [4] , [5] , and the electrocaloric effect [6] , [7] . The other explores the coupling between ferroelectric polarization and light, such as the electro-optic (non-linear optics) effect [8] , bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , and photoelectric or photocatalytic applications [14] , [15] , [16] . Despite significant efforts in both areas, the practical application of ferroelectrics still faces significant challenges. One of the most promising and challenging applications of ferroelectrics is the conversion of solar energy into electricity or chemicals, facilitated by the intrinsic advantages of asymmetrical unit cells for charge separation and transfer [17] , [18] . Distinct from other semiconductors, where carrier migration primarily occurs through drift and diffusion, ferroelectrics exhibit a unique mechanism: before screening, carriers predominantly migrate by drifting within the depolarization electric field. Specifically, positive holes and negative electrons move in opposite polarization directions [19] , [20] , [21] , [22] , and increasing the thickness along the polarization direction of ferroelectric PbTiO 3 enhances the driving force for charge separation, consequently augmenting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities [19] . This distinct structural characteristic of ferroelectrics makes them particularly suitable as photocatalysts. Despite the theoretical threshold of around 10 5 kV/cm for electric field present within ferroelectrics, which is about 3–4 orders of magnitude higher than that measured in conventional semiconductor photocatalysts [23] , ferroelectric catalysts have unexpectedly shown relatively poor water splitting performance in actual practice. In fact, the efficiencies reported so far for ferroelectrics are significantly lower compared to other strategies, such as p-n junctions [24] , [25] , [26] , heterojunctions [27] , [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] , facet engineering [32] , [33] , defect introduction and doping methods [34] , [35] , [36] , cocatalysts [37] , [38] , the Dember effect [39] , and Z-scheme systems [40] , [41] . Efforts have been made to enhance the depolarization field of ferroelectric catalysts by mitigating the internal screening charges, which naturally occur alongside the formation of the crystal structure. In this context, pioneering research has shown that the activity is moderately increased when these internal screening charges are partially eliminated, indicating that such elimination can contribute to improved activity [42] . In particular, a recent study has demonstrated that the growth of SrTiO 3 (STO) nanolayers on the positively polarized surface of PbTiO 3 (PTO) particles enhances the overall water-splitting activity by a factor of 15 [43] . It is hypothesized that the enhancement may be attributed to the reduced Schottky barrier height and increased dispersion of the cocatalyst. However, despite these significant advancements over the last several decades, it is worth noting that ferroelectrics have a larger electric field for charge separation compared to the other strategies mentioned above [19] , [44] . This suggests that the inherent driving force for charge separation within the bulk phase of ferroelectric materials is not an impediment to achieving high photocatalytic activity. This raises an important question: what are the key factors limiting the transfer of photogenerated charges to surface reaction sites? Understanding this challenge is essential for unlocking the full potential of ferroelectric materials to achieve significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance. In this work, a profound mechanistic study was carried out to investigate the role of defective structures on the efficiency of photogenerated electrons from the positive surface of PTO in the overall water-splitting reaction. Our study shows that the main obstacle for efficient photocatalytic water splitting by PTO is the existence of Ti defects at the positive polarization facets that inhibit efficient electron transfer for hydrogen production. By eliminating abundant Ti defective sites on the positive surface of PTO through the growth of STO nanolayers, AQE@365 nm of the overall water splitting was elevated by 400 times due to the construction of a highly efficient electron transfer route. Precise control of surface defects is a potent strategy for improving ferroelectric photocatalyst performance in water splitting.",
