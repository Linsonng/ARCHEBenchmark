    "content": "Bubbles often appear to have a life of their own. Da Vinci [1] was a pioneer in documenting their capricious behavior, observing how rising bubbles spontaneously abandon straight paths for mesmerizing helices—a paradox that has persisted for centuries [2] , [3] . When exposed to acoustic excitations, bubbles may also transition from in-place pulsations, opting instead to ‘dance’ along zigzag paths reminiscent of Brownian motion [4] , [5] . Bubbles can exhibit violent dynamics: under sudden pressure changes, they may swiftly collapse, giving rise to shock waves that pose significant harm to machinery—a phenomenon known as cavitation [6] , [7] , which some crustaceans even leverage to stun prey [8] . In some instances, the implosion may become so intense that the bubbles emit a spark of light [9] . Bubbles may also appear to violate Archimedes’ principle [10] , e.g., bubbles in vertically oscillating baths may overcome buoyancy and sink contradicting common intuition [11] , [12] , [13] . Waves of bubbles surging downwards may be also observed in carbonated drinks [14] , resulting from convection currents in the core of the glass [15] , [16] . Additional examples showcasing the fascinating dynamics of bubbles can be found in innumerable settings, spanning soft and biological matter [17] , geophysical flows [18] , and industrial processes [19] . Here, we demonstrate that a bubble inside a vertically vibrated fluid chamber may spontaneously break symmetry and start to ‘gallop’ along the upper wall, self-propelled through a resonant interaction between its vibration modes (Fig. 1 a, Supplementary Movie 1 ). By adjusting the vibrational forcing, these galloping bubbles may be tuned to transition between different domain exploration modes, including rectilinear, orbital, and run-and-tumble motion (Fig. 1 b–d). Moreover, similar to jellyfish and other marine invertebrates that deform their bodies to swim without vortex shedding [20] , [21] , [22] , we show that galloping bubbles leverage inertial fluid forces to advance, thus enabling propulsion in inviscid flows where viscous traction is not possible [23] . Fig. 1: Galloping bubbles. a Time sequence illustrating a self-propelling bubble under the upper boundary of a vertically vibrating fluid chamber (Supplementary Movie 1 ), exhibiting shape oscillations reminiscent of galloping motion. The inset includes a schematic of the setup, and T =  2 π / ω is the oscillation period. The bubbles were backlit through a gradient filter to enhance their aesthetic appeal. Different bubble sizes and vibrational forcings produce diverse domain exploration modes, observed from the top view ( b – d ), Supplementary Movie 2 ). A bubble may gallop in ( b ) steady rectilinear motion in an infinite bath, with its trajectory becoming circular here due to the chamber’s boundary (dashed line, see Methods, Experiments). Time progression is indicated by the green arrow, with increasing opacity indicating later times, and the image sequence intervals are 20 T . Depending on the bubble volume, increasing the forcing amplitude A may cause the bubble’s trajectory to curve, leading to orbital states ( c ), which can develop anywhere within the chamber, or become jagged with random sharp turns ( d ) reminiscent of ‘run-and-tumble’ motion [36] , [37] . e A phase map at f = 40 Hz illustrates the dependence of the bubble’s dynamics on the driving acceleration and bubble volume, which also includes detachment from the wall for smaller bubbles and breakup for large amplitudes. Full size image Given the multifaceted physics of bubbles, harnessing their dynamics may be challenging but holds significant potential rewards. Actuated-bubble technologies have been developed for various purposes across numerous fields. In medicine, bubbles have been used for manipulating and assessing the mechanical properties of cells [24] , as well as for drug and gene delivery [25] . Also, bubbles have been exploited as a cleaning tool to treat wastewater [26] , prevent biofouling [27] , and clear bacteria from narrow conduits [28] , [29] . Manipulating bubble motion is particularly valuable in boiling-based heat transfer, a common method for cooling electronic microdevices, where unremoved bubbles near the heat source can significantly reduce heat transfer efficiency [30] . This challenge is exacerbated in micro-gravity settings, such as those encountered by microchips in satellites and spacecrafts, where the absence of buoyancy complicates bubble evacuation [31] , [32] , [33] . To foster new bubble-based technologies, we present a series of proof-of-concept experiments that showcase the versatility of the galloping dynamics and inform new methods for producing bubbles with tunable size, sorting and removal of bubbles, navigating fluid networks, and cleaning surfaces.",
