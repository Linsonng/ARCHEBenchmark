    "content": "The conversion of external information into biological signals by the sensory nervous system is at the core of how living organisms interact with their environment [1] , [2] , [3] . Receiving the majority of the external information as visual cues, the human visual system is able to recognize and remember the identity of a wide range of objects. The processes in human visual system processes have thus inspired the development of artificial visual systems implemented through electronic devices [4] , [5] . Optoelectronic synapses have been instrumental in the progression of such neuromorphic devices that can decode images [6] , [7] , [8] or enable artificial vision [9] . However, most optoelectronic devices utilized in hardware neural networks and neural interfaces are composed of inorganic materials, which are often mechanically hard, not biocompatible and lack additional functionalities. Rendering these devices light responsive requires additional circuit elements whose operational mechanisms are fundamentally different than those found in biological systems [10] . Organic mixed ionic-electronic charge conductors (OMIECs) are ideal electronic materials for developing artificial circuits as they can emulate the ion-mediated mechanisms of biological synapses [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] . OMIECs are soft conjugated polymers that exhibit volumetric ionic and electronic charge transport in their films with often compatibility with living systems. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) leverage the mixed conductivity of OMIECs by incorporating their solution-processed films in microscale channels and translating ionic, biological information in aqueous media into amplified electronic signals [17] , [18] . The OMIEC channel achieves multiple, distinct doping states through small ionic fluxes in the electrolyte, generating high device transconductance at low operating voltages (<1 V) [19] , [20] , [21] . OECTs have been shown to exhibit both long-term and short-term plasticity behavior, with high potential for integration as artificial synapses [22] , [23] . For neuromorphic vision engineering, OMIECs feature one crucial property that has yet to be exploited: the ability to absorb light [24] , [25] . A few recent reports have demonstrated the application of OECTs as optoelectronic synapses converting light-based signals into spike-train signal patterns [26] . However, these studies do not leverage the light sensitivity of OMIECs in the channel but rather depend on light-sensitive materials integrated into large-area gate electrodes [25] , [27] , rendering these systems difficult to operate, miniaturize, and integrate. The only demonstration of a miniaturized OECT-based optoelectronic synapse, which generated a non-volatile light-induced memory, used conventional organic semiconductors [10] (a bi-component donor/acceptor system, P3HT:PCBM), in the channel, which are not compatible with aqueous electrolytes and require a toxic ionic liquid as the electrolyte. Moreover, while current organic synaptic transistors have demonstrated light signal processing capability, they can process information at only one wavelength or a restricted range of wavelengths [28] , [29] , [30] . Furthermore, mimicking the human visual system demands multi-functional materials that are responsive to both light and electrical stimuli, as visual memory and recognition rely on photoreceptor cells that capture visual information and afferent neurons that transmit this input as electrical signals. Thus, to build a biomimetic optoelectronic synapse, the development of multi-stimuli-responsive OMIECs with the ability to perceive multispectral visual information is key to surpassing the functionality of single-mode (electric or optical) drives [31] . Here we develop an organic ion-tunable optoelectrochemical synapse by using a single-component OMIEC as the OECT channel that responds to both light and voltage stimuli applied through an aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 1a ). The OMIEC we designed is an n-type, all electron-accepting copolymer consisting of bisistain-lactone and bithiazole (p(C2F-z)) (Fig. 1b ), synthesized through the green Aldol polymerization technique. Our synapse demonstrates multispectral visual perception covering a broad wavelength range (ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions), even beyond the perception range of the human visual system. Our single-component material is responsive not only to optical stimuli but also to electrical input, further mimicking the electrical transmission in the retina. The optoelectrochemical synapse emulates the functionality of a biological synapse such as synaptic plasticity and pair-pulse facilitation, and it exhibits the transition of a short-term memory to a long-term memory at low programming voltages (0.4 V), emulating the learning experience of the brain. Through a combination of in situ and ex situ optoelectrochemical methods, we investigate the working mechanism of these devices, which relies on the light-induced aqueous ion-based doping of the channel, with the extent precisely controlled by the training pattern. By building a synaptic array based on an 8 \\(\\times\\) 8 array of these devices on a 9.4 \\(\\times\\) 6.6 mm 2 area, we show this aquoues electrolyte compatible device’s capability for image recognition, preprocessing, and memory. In addition, we demonstrate the use of our device for in-sensor reservoir computing and full-color image processing, highlighting its capability for decoding multitask spatiotemporal events and extracting color information in biological media. Lastly, our synaptic device performs temporal summation under high-frequency electrical pulses, which we leverage for motion recognition. Fig. 1: Optoelectrochemical synapse based on an n-type organic electrochemical transistor. Schematic illustrations of ( a ) a biological synapse (left) and our transistor design that acts as an ion-tunable optoelectrochemical synapse (right). In the human visual system, communication between neurons occurs through synapses. The stimulation of the presynaptic membrane generates an action potential that results in the flow of ions towards the postsynaptic neuron. The OECT based synapse mimics this function by responding to external optical and electrical signals and converting them into a frequency encoded current output. In synapses, synaptic weight is responsible for learning and storing visual information and memory. b Chemical structure of p(C2F-z) with the microscope image of its film in the microscale OECT channel (length = 10 µm, width = 100 µm, d = 79 nm) and the lateral Au gate electrode.
