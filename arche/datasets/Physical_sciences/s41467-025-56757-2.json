    "content": "Beyond traditional organic thin-film transistors [1] , [2] , conjugated polymers (CPs) are now pioneering in wearable [3] , biocompatible [4] , and neuromorphic [5] , [6] thin-film electronics attributed to their unique combination of molecular diversity, electronic versatility, and mechanical flexibility [7] . The semiconducting capabilities of CPs are essentially determined by long-range delocalization of electronic wave functions across polymer chains. Consequently, single crystals characterized by perfect coplanar conformations, minimum energetic disorders, and enhanced carrier mobility have been widely recognized as an ideal platform to not only access the peak semiconducting performances but also explore the inherent structure-property relationships [8] . However, the manufacturing of CP single crystals remains significantly challenging, mainly ascribed to the intrinsic contradiction between the energetic preference and the entropic cost for organizing random polymer chains into well-ordered arrangements [9] . This challenging is further exacerbated in thin films, where two-dimensional constraints limit the spatial freedom of chains to arrange into the energetically favorable crystalline state, and the π-π stackings along two-dimensional scales are more easily disrupted by molecular irregularities, thermal agitations, and mechanical detachments. To this end, we explore down to the molecular level of CPs, where electronegativity differences between carbon and heteroatoms create localized molecular dipoles due to the asymmetric distribution of electrons. From the thermodynamic perspective, molecular dipoles may serve as subtle modulators to influence the energy landscape of π-π stackings, thus lowering the energy barrier towards a single-crystal state. On the kinetic front, molecular dipoles are expected to accelerate the nucleation by fostering highly-ordered initial states, and in turn contribute to more uniform and rapid crystal growths. Unfortunately, accelerated nucleation is often accompanied by high-density random crystal nuclei, leading to polycrystals with abundant grains [10] . In addition, molecular dipoles are highly sensitive to both molecular configurations and stacking conformations. Although external forces such as fluid flow [11] , [12] , mechanical stress [13] , [14] , and electric field [15] , [16] have been employed for aligned arrangements of polymer chains, these approaches are constrained by the lack of nanoscopic controls over twisted molecular configurations [17] , [18] . Therefore, achieving a delicate equilibrium between localized molecular rotations and comprehensive chain alignments remains elusive, and the involved complex dynamics hampers efforts to precisely modulate the crystallization process of CPs at the thin-film level, a goal that has yet to be readily achieved. Herein, we introduce a universal nanoconfined molecular-dipole orienting (nano-CMDO) strategy for precise assembly of CPs into single-crystal thin films. Capitalizing on our rational design of spatial-electrostatic nanoconfined capacitor, molecular dipoles are demonstrated to rotate conjugated backbones in response to a perpendicular electric field, while alkyl-modified parallel plates are engineered to regulate side chains. As a result, a series of prototype CPs, including polythiophenes, polytheinothiophenes, p -type and n -type donor-acceptor copolymers, are manufactured into microscale-size high-quantity single-crystal thin films. These films exhibit ultralow energetic disorders with the minimal Urbach energy of 25 meV, even below the thermal fluctuation energy at room temperature (i.e., k B T = 26 meV). Trap-free space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) behaviors are observed with notably low trap densities of 10 15 –10 16 cm −3 . A high transistor mobility of 15.5 cm 2 V −1 s −1 is achieved to exemplify the substantial potential of these CP single-crystal thin films for high-performance organic electronics. Our nano-CMDO strategy offers a promising non-epitaxial avenue for the single-crystal growth of conjugated polymers.",
