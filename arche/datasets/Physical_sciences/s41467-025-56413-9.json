    "content": "Since the last revision of the International System of Units (SI) in May 20, 2019, founded on seven fixed constants of nature [1] , [2] , any source generating an electric current which can be expressed in terms of e f , with e the elementary charge and f a frequency in Hz (s −1 ), provides a realisation of the ampere. Single-electron current sources (SECS) [3] , [4] , [5] , which are mesoscopic devices [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , able to handle electrons one by one at a rate f e , are often presented as the most obvious way to realize the definition. However, achieving currents above 100 pA using GaAs and Si-based tunable-barrier SECS accurate to within a relative uncertainty better than 10 −7 remains a very challenging goal because of increasing error rates at high frequencies (~1 GHz) [15] , [16] . Very recently, as a consequence of the phase-charge quantum mechanical duality in Josephson junctions (JJ), dual Shapiro steps have been evidenced in superconducting nanowires and small JJ placed in high impedance environments under microwave radiation [17] , [18] , [19] . Here, the enhanced phase variance allows photon-assisted tunneling of fluxons ϕ 0 = h /2 e ( h is the Planck constant) and a synchronized transfer of Cooper pairs. Sharp current steps appearing at integer multiples of 2 e f e in the DC current-voltage characteristics could be promising candidates as quantum sources in the nanoampere range, although their flatness is still in debate [20] . More generally, for all mesoscopic current sources, the control of charge fluctuations, which are dependent on the device coupling with the electromagnetic environment, remains a crucial issue. Concurrently, another route to the SI realization consists in applying Ohm’s law to the Josephson voltage and quantum Hall resistance standards, since the Josephson effect [21] and the quantum Hall effect [22] now provide direct and universal realizations of the volt and the ohm from h /2 e and h / e 2 constants, respectively [2] , with a 10 −9 measurement uncertainty. The high accuracy of the Josephson voltage standards, which are series arrays of JJ, relies on the phase rigidity of macroscopic superconductors. Under application of dc current bias and a microwave radiation f J , the transfer through each JJ of one fluxon per period of the microwave tone is ensured and results in a quantized voltage V = n J ϕ 0 f J [23] , where n J is the number of JJ. If this quantized voltage can be accurately applied to a quantum Hall resistance standard (QHRS) in the ν =2 Landau level filling factor, taking advantage of the charge rigidity of the quantum Hall edge states, n J e charges are transferred at a rate f J through the QHRS of h /2 e 2 resistance. Hence, a current n J e f J , easily reaching microamperes, can be generated. Recently, a calculable current of 1 μA generated from the series connection of both quantum standards has been measured with a relative uncertainty of 1.3 × 10 −7 [24] , [25] , but the accuracy was reached owing to the very low-resistance of the ammeter (~0.1 mΩ). The main issue is therefore to implement the accurate series connection of the two quantum standards while realizing a true current source. The programmable quantum current generator (PQCG) [26] , [27] , [28] has addressed this issue by locking an electron flow to the current circulating in the loop formed by the quantum standards, with the help of a superconducting amplifier, allowing simultaneously the scaling over a wider range of current values. Its accuracy was demonstrated in the milliampere range with a relative measurement uncertainty of 10 −8 . This result was however obtained at the expense of corrections of the order of a few parts in 10 7 , originating from the non-ideal connection of the quantum standards, and determined after time consuming additional measurements. This impaired the final uncertainty, the simplicity and hence the full potential of the new quantum current standard. Here, we report on a next-generation PQCG able of delivering lower-noise currents, at the theoretical quantized values driven by the Josephson frequency, without any classical correction. This performance results from the implementation of a three-terminal connection of the QHRS, which allows a highly-accurate application of the Josephson voltage to the quantized resistance. We demonstrate the realization of the ampere with relative uncertainties below 10 −8 for different current levels, filling the gap between the milliampere range and the microampere range. This is achieved using a full quantum instrumentation made of five quantum devices, which opens the way to the realization of several electrical units in a single experiment.",
