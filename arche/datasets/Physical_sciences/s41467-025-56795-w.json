    "content": "Single-crystal optical actuators are stimulating a new field of chemistry, given their wide-ranging prospective applications that range from light-driven molecular machinery [1] , [2] , [3] , to microrobotics [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] , to optical data storage [8] , to futuristic quantum-computing circuitry [9] . Single crystals are a particularly attractive form of an optically actuating material since they offer a highly pure solid-state medium for photonic control. Crystalline actuators whose functional origins lie in light-induced structural changes are especially alluring because such changes exhibit long-range effects that propagate throughout a periodic crystal-lattice environment; thereby affording an ordered array of photonic signatures. These photostructural effects are often correlated, and ‘out-of-equilibrium’ in nature, a characteristic that has been coined as ‘the real terra nova of solid-state chemistry’ [10] . Single-crystal optical actuation has been demonstrated in a diverse range of organic, inorganic and organometallic compounds [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , [21] , [22] , [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] . Coordination complexes that contain transition metals, such as ruthenium, are of particular interest since they exhibit metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) that gives rise to broad-band optical absorption, while maintaining good thermal stability. Linkage photoisomerisation is often the molecular-scale phenomenon that underpins the microscopic manifestation of single-crystal optical actuation in coordination complexes [24] . We therefore sought to discover a new single-crystal optical actuator by developing an extended series of ruthenium-tetraammine complexes that undergo SO 2 -linkage photoisomerisation [27] , [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] , [33] , [34] , [35] , [36] , [37] , [38] , [39] , [40] , [41] , [42] , [43] , [44] , [45] . Their generic formula is trans -[Ru(SO 2 )(NH 3 ) 4 (X)] m+ Y n , where X is a trans ligand relative to the photoactive SO 2 ligand, Y is a counter ion and m and n are integers whose values are determined by charge balancing (hereafter, these will be known as [RuSO 2 ] complexes). Many variations of X and Y can support one or both η 1 -OSO or η 2 -(OS)O photoisomeric configurations within the single-crystal form, whose light-induced structure is metastable when kept suitably cooled (typically to 100 K) and which thermally reverts to its η 1 -SO 2 dark-state crystal structure. Single-crystal optical actuation has been reported in one [RuSO 2 ] complex, to date, and adopts the form of a thermally-reversible macroscopic crystal-peeling effect [38] . Peeling is one of the more novel types of macroscopic crystalline deformations that may occur in complexes, owing to the untenable crystal strain that molecular-scale photostructural effects can impart: crystals may peel, bend, stretch, crack, fracture or explode, when subjected to light [11] . This peeling effect was deemed to stabilise the substantial but incomplete (52%) photoconversion level of the η 1 -OSO isomer in [Ru(SO 2 )(NH 3 ) 4 (3-phenylpyridine)]Cl 2 .H 2 O [38] . A [RuSO 2 ] complex would ideally support 100% SO 2 -linkage photoisomerisation so that the dark- (0) and light-induced (1,2,…) states can be readily distinguished as integer encodings for photonic applications. Yet, until now, complete η 1 -OSO photoconversion had only been reported in single crystals of two [RuSO 2 ] complexes [42] , [44] , neither of which display macroscopic optical actuation. Furthermore, the η 2 -(OS)O photoisomer that is often found in [RuSO 2 ] complexes has never been structurally isolated with 100% photoconversion; rather, it has been found to co-exist with one or both of the η 1 -OSO photoisomer and η 1 -SO 2 dark-state configurations [27] , [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] , [33] , [34] , [35] , [36] , [37] , [38] , [43] , [45] . This paper reports the discovery of a new [RuSO 2 ] complex, trans -[Ru(SO 2 )(NH 3 ) 4 (4-bromopyridine)]tosylate 2 ] ( 1 , Fig. 1a ) that exhibits a thermally-reversible ‘cracking’ form of single-crystal optical actuation. Thereby, we show that its η 1 -SO 2 dark-state crystal structure undergoes 100% SO 2 -linkage photoisomerisation to create a pure η 1 -OSO photoisomeric crystal structure at 90 K or a pure η 2 -(OS)O photoisomeric species at 100 K. Each photoisomer is metastable at their stated temperature and is accompanied by a substantial level of micro- and nanoscopic crystal strain, which diminishes as 1 thermally recovers its η 1 -SO 2 dark-state crystal structure. Fig. 1: Chemical Structure of 1 in its dark-state and photoisomeric forms. a Chemical schematic diagram of 1 , whose ( b ) crystals can be light and temperature tuned to behave as a ternary molecular switch (Data: 0, 1, 2). The molecular origins of this ternary switching behaviour lie in photostructural changes within the crystal structure of 1 , caused by 100% SO 2 linkage photoisomerisation that occurs when the crystal is exposed to 505 nm light while maintained at low-temperature: the η 1 -OSO or η 2 -(OS)O photoisomer forms at 90 K or 100 K, respectively. The latter photoisomer can also be generated by warming up the former by 10 K. The η 1 -SO 2 dark-state crystal structure is recovered upon warming up the crystal. c The asymmetric unit of the three crystal structures of 1 captured in each of its isomeric-state configurations. Anisotropic displacement parameters are shown at the 50% probability level. Hydrogen atoms and tosylate counterions are omitted for clarity. Full size image This demonstration of three distinct 100%-converted SO 2 -linkage isomeric species in a [RuSO 2 ] complex is important because it reveals the foundational possibility of creating ternary photonic signatures of high purity in single-crystal optical actuators (Fig. 1b ). We now describe our findings through the structural and optical characteristics of 1 which we determined using in-situ light-induced single-crystal X-ray diffraction (also known as ‘photocrystallography’) [46] , [47] , [48] , single-crystal optical-absorption spectroscopy and optical microscopy [41] and in-situ light-induced low-temperature atomic-force microscopy. These findings also show how its ternary molecular switching can be controlled by temperature and visible light (Fig. 1b ).",
