    "content": "The Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis from N 2 and H 2 is one of the most important scientific inventions in modern society [1] , [2] . Ammonia is used in the production of fertilizers or as an energy carrier for use as fuel or in power plants [2] . The Haber-Bosch process requires harsh reaction conditions with temperatures in the range of 673 –773 K and high pressures (10–30 MPa). In fact, nearly 2% of the world’s energy consumption is attributed to the Haber-Bosch process [3] , which motivates the search for ammonia synthesis catalysts with activity at lower temperatures. Ru is known to be the ideal metal catalyst for ammonia synthesis under industrial conditions [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] . Ru is a scarce metal, and to utilize the catalyst efficiently and sustainably, there is a need to develop a new generation of Ru catalysts with higher activity [8] , [9] , [10] . Technical Ru catalysts for the ammonia synthesis reaction are composed of supported Ru nanoparticles (NPs), exposing different crystal facets and sites to the gas phase. The sizes and shapes of Ru NPs are generally ill-defined, making the contributions of different particles to the kinetic properties difficult to disentangle. Thus, it is challenging to establish clear structure-reactivity relations for technical Ru catalysts. Experimentally, fundamental studies are typically carried out on well-defined Ru surfaces to facilitate the understanding of the kinetic importance of different types of sites [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] . Computationally, the potential energy surfaces for ammonia synthesis over different single-crystal surfaces have been evaluated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations [8] , [15] . Moreover, different types of DFT-based mean-field microkinetic models have been constructed to study the kinetic behavior and identify active sites. The present understanding is that N 2 dissociation is limiting the rate and that this elementary reaction is facilitated by the presence of step sites, such as the well-known B 5 site [8] . Following the knowledge of active sites, strategies have been proposed to promote the reactivity of undercoordinated sites [16] or to increase the number of active sites on Ru NPs [17] , [18] , [19] . Modeling catalytic NPs as isolated single-crystal surfaces does not capture the structural complexity of NPs, which contain a range of different sites. The site assembly offers the possibility of kinetic couplings where different parts of the reaction occur on different sites according to the principle of least resistance [20] , [21] , [22] . Moreover, model catalysts with ideal surfaces generally do not account for the inherent strain, which is always present in metal NPs. Technical NPs are inherently strained due to the structural mismatch caused by grain boundaries, interaction with the support material, and surface defects [23] , [24] , [25] . Strain is known to affect the d-states of Ru [26] , which modifies the potential energy surface of the ammonia synthesis reaction [27] , [28] . As a consequence, the surface models commonly used in kinetic analysis of the ammonia synthesis reaction over Ru make it challenging to describe kinetic properties, such as turnover frequency (TOF) and apparent activation energy of technical Ru NPs. The recent development of advanced synthesis and characterization techniques for well-defined Ru NPs opens an opportunity to link the structure and function of technical Ru NPs. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy makes it possible to measure the strain distribution in Ru NPs directly [29] , [30] , [31] . The influence of kinetic couplings and inherent strain on catalytic activity is, however, still difficult to uncover solely based on experiments. In this work, first-principles based kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations are performed to investigate the kinetic properties of Ru NPs for ammonia synthesis. We find that the combined effect of structural complexity and inherent strain is required to account for the experimentally measured TOF. The simulations reveal that kinetic couplings between different sites yield high catalytic activity, as the N 2 dissociation and NH x (x = 0, 1, and 2) hydrogenation steps occur on different sites, which communicate via rapid adsorbate diffusion. Inherent random strain further enhances the activity by promoting the reaction on sites for both N 2 dissociation and NH x hydrogenation. Our work suggests that kinetic coupling on strained-designed Ru NPs offers a possibility to break the limitation of scaling relations [32] in ammonia synthesis, thereby enabling the design of new generations of Ru catalysts.",
