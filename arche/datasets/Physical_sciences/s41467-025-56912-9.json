    "content": "Two-dimensional (2D) solids are distinguished from bulk solids because of their constrained longitudinal dimensionality [1] . With very high aspect ratios and thicknesses corresponding to a few atomic layers, the 2D materials including graphene, oxides, hydroxides, sulfides and boron nitrides have been reported with interesting properties and promising applications [2] , [3] , [4] . Among them, 2D metal oxides (MOs) are a large family with unique combinations of redox chemistry, abundant defect sites, rapid mass transport and high earth abundance, endowing them with widespread applications ranging from catalysts and energy-storage devices to semiconductors. Mechanical/chemical/ultrasonic exfoliation [5] , [6] , [7] , chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [2] , [8] , template method [9] , solvo-/hydrothermal methods [10] etc., have been used to fabricate novel 2D architectures. Similar with the fabrication of graphene by exfoliating layered graphite, some types of 2D metal oxide nanosheets have been produced via the “top-down” strategy. For instance, nine types of 2D hexagonal metal oxide monolayers (TiO 2 , MnO, Fe 2 O 3 etc.) have been prepared via exfoliation method [5] . The bulk metal surface could be polished and oxidized to layered metal oxide in oxygen-deficient environment, which was easily obtained after mechanical exfoliation. Meanwhile, liquid-phase exfoliation also was used in metal oxide sheets production [11] . Ultrasonic waves could break the van der Waals (vdW) forces between the metal oxide layers, following the liquid-phase exfoliation and stabilization in liquids. It is clear that exfoliation is suitable for cleavage those original frameworks contain a layered structure, which rely on weak vdW forces to maintain the interlayer interaction. Considering that most metal oxides are not intrinsically layered, the formation of 2D metal oxide nanosheets via exfoliation is quite limited. The “bottom-up” strategy has also been developed for the 2D metal oxides synthesis. Although CVD is more flexible, its large-scale application is extremely restricted by its high energy intensity, limited product types and low yield. The wet-chemical synthesis method benefits from low-cost, high-yield and simple operation. By wet-chemical system, Zhao et al. [9] synthesized ultrathin 2D metal oxides including MgO, Al 2 O 3 , SnO 2 , ZrO 2 , TiO 2 , and Sb 2 O 5 using graphene oxide (GO) as template. The metal cations was adsorbed on the GO surface, and hydrolyzed gradually in the liquid-phase reaction with precisely controlled temperature and pH. Notably, it is restricted by the solution pH, solubility and hydrolysis of precursors. A strategy involving the use of surfaces of water-soluble salt crystals as growth substrates to synthesize 2D transition metal oxides such as MoO 3 , MoO 2 , MnO, and WO 3 from solution has been discovered [12] . It remains a challenging task if the precursors are hydrolyzed violently or refractorily. Seeking a versatile and facile method to fabricate 2D metal oxide crystals is an appealing endeavor. Confinement synthesis in a fixed interlayer is the transverse growth of 2D target guest species by utilizing the layer spacing of lamellar framework in combination with template. Due to the fixed spacing between the layers of template, the longitudinal dimension of target products can be strictly limited. Very recently, Guo’s group [13] reported the solution preparation of free-standing nitrogen-doped amorphous monolayer carbon within the interlayer cavity of layered double hydroxides (LDHs), indicating the feasibility of confined polymerization using solid templates. Herein, we developed the confined interlayer growth strategy in combination with a melt infiltration method under dry-chemical conditions, achieving the synthesis of various ultrathin 2D metal oxide crystals (2D MOs), including 3 d transition metal (Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zr, and W) oxides, lanthanide (Ce) oxides and nontransition metal (In, Sn, and Bi) oxides. The synthesized 2D MOs presented ultrathin monolayer structures, which perfectly inherited the layer morphology of the parent compound RUB-15. All the 2D MOs exhibited high crystallinity through modulation of the growth conditions. Each MO monolayer was held by vdW forces rather than ionic bonds, which was distinctly different from those in the bulk phase. The ultrathin 2D crystals exposed large surfaces and edge regions, which formed multiple defects and strains that led to lattice distortions. The obtained 2D TiO 2 nanosheets demonstrated outstanding degradation efficiency for various persistent organic pollutants, including phenolic compounds and antibiotics, in 120 min. Moreover, five kinds of 2D transition metal sulfides (MSs), including FeS 2 , CoS, NiS 2 , Cu 9 S 5 , and SnS 2 have been synthesized in this strategy. The method is flexible for the construction of other ultrathin 2D frameworks, such as binary MOs, sulfide/phosphide or metallene nanosheets, which highlights the multidisciplinary exploration of 2D crystals with unique properties.",
