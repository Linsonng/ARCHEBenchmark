    "content": "Chiral materials featuring circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are currently garnering significant attention for their potential applications in 3D displays, quantum computing, spintronic devices, and information storage [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] . The luminescence dissymmetry factor, g lum , is a key metric to evaluate CPL performance, which is obtained from Eq. ( 1 ): $${g}_{{\\mbox{lum}}}=\\frac{2({I}_{{\\mbox{L}}}-{I}_{{\\mbox{R}}})}{{I}_{{\\mbox{L}}}+{I}_{{\\mbox{R}}}}=\\frac{4{{{\\bf{m}}}}{{{\\boldsymbol{\\mu }}}}\\cos (\\theta )}{{{{{\\bf{m}}}}}^{2}+{{{{\\boldsymbol{\\mu }}}}}^{2}}$$ (1) where I L and I R represent the emission intensities of left- and right-handed circularly polarized light, μ and m are the electric and magnetic transition dipole moment vectors, respectively, and θ is the angle between these two vectors [5] , [6] . Generally, | μ | is much larger than | m | , leading to a mismatch between electric and magnetic transition dipole moment, which results the g lum value around 10 −4 to 10 −3 . An ideal CPL emitter should have both large g lum and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), the former represents the polarization purity of the emitted light, while the latter evaluates the effectiveness of energy conversion. In this case, the figure of merit (FOM) has been proposed to quantify CPL performance and estimate the potential of materials for practical applications, which can be calculated by the product of g lum and PLQY (FOM = g lum × PLQY) [7] , [8] . The design challenges lie in balancing the g lum and PLQY via modulating both the value and orientation of μ and m . Numerous researches in this field have already been carried out and a series of excellent CPL-active materials have emerged including chiral organic small molecules [9] , [10] , inorganic nanomaterials [11] , [12] , and metal complexes [13] , [14] , [15] . However, most of them are barely promising for brilliant CPL emitters due to their high cost, poor thermal stability and luminescence intensity. For example, the synthesis of chiral organic molecules or chiral metal complexes is tedious and costly, and they often suffer from poor thermal stability and low luminescence intensity. Inorganic nanomaterials, on the other hand, require coating prefabricated nanomaterials with chiral passivating ligands to achieve CPL, and their properties are challenging to precisely control. Recently, lead-free metal halide hybrids have become a research hotspot due to their low cost and facile synthesis [16] , [17] , diverse topological structures [18] , [19] , and high PLQY [20] , [21] . The use of chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect further endows such materials more stable intrinsic chirality with excellent CPL behavior, positioning them as promising candidates for high-performance CPL emitters [22] , [23] . The principle involves directly incorporating chiral organic cations into the metal halide lattice, imparting them inherent chirality. The asymmetric hydrogen bonds between chiral organic cations and halide ions often exacerbate lattice distortion, leading to the deformation of excited state. This deformed excited state further induces the generation of self-trapped excitons (STEs), thereby initiating efficient STEs emission and exhibiting chiral luminescent properties. Several significant achievements have been realized in chiral lead-free metal halides [24] , [25] , [26] , [27] , [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] , [33] , [34] . For instance, Quan et al. reported a pair of 0D indium-antimony chlorides with near-unity STEs emission and g lum of ±1.0 × 10 −2 [35] . Mao and colleagues realized a g lum of ±2.3 × 10 − 2 in the 1D chiral Mn-based halides ( R / S -3-quinuclidinol)MnBr 3 with PLQY of 50.2% [36] . Additionally, Xu et al. reported two CPL-active metal halide enantiomers: 0D ( R / S -C 6 H 15 ClNO) 2 •SbCl 5 (C 6 H 15 ClNO + = (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl)trimethylammonium cation) and 1D ( D / L )-( tert -butylprolinate)MnCl 3 with the PLQY higher than 70% [37] , [38] . The g lum for 0D ( R / S -C 6 H 15 ClNO) 2 •SbCl 5 is ± 3.0 × 10 − 4 , while for 1D ( D / L )-( tert -butylprolinate)MnCl 3 is ±6.0 × 10 −3 . Recently, Zhang’s team reported the best-brightness CPL-active metal halides to date using the cascade cationic insertion strategy with FOM value reaching 2.26 × 10 −2 [25] . Despite the progress, the CPL performance implemented above is still not governed by any specific rules and is typically obtained through a trial-and-error approach. Therefore, it is highly needed to clarify the relationship between structures and chiroptical properties in chiral metal halide hybrids and provide effective guidance for designing efficient circularly polarized light sources. In this work, we develope an efficient strategy to achieve both high PLQY and large g lum in chiral metal halide hybrids by regulating their structural dimensions (Fig. 1 ). Specifically, the 0D, 1D, and 3D In-based hybrids are rationally designed and constructed by tuning the size and polarization of chiral organic cations with strong hydrogen-bonding-acceptors (oxygen heteroatom), which can coordinate with K + ions and enhance the chirality transfer. Bright emission with the near-unity PLQY is obtained in these hybrids. Furthermore, the contradiction between PLQY and g lum is overcame by regulating the structural dimensions which enhances the chiral induction effect and balances the values of electric and magnetic transition dipole moment. As a result, the g lum of these hybrids show an exponential growth from 10 − 3 to nearly 10 − 1 orders of magnitude as the structural dimension increases from 0D to 3D. Both the | g lum | (0.89 × 10 − 1 ) and FOM (0.79 × 10 − 1 ) are the highest values among the reported chiral metal halides to date. Our work elucidates the relationship between structural dimension and g lum in chiral metal halides, and provides a simple pathway for the rational design of efficient CPL-active metal halide hybrids with both high PLQY and large g lum .
