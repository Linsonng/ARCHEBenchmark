    "content": "Negative refraction of electromagnetic waves [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] is characterised by counter-intuitive phenomena, such as the bending of waves in a medium in the opposite direction to what normally occurs and the amplification of evanescent waves in the bulk [8] , [9] . These entail possibilities of transformative applications, including cloaking [10] , [11] , [12] and superlensing [9] , [13] , and have also gained considerable attention in other wave types, such as elastic and acoustic waves [14] , [15] . Metamaterials, synthetic man-made media, were developed to overcome limitations of natural materials, with these unconventional refraction phenomena serving as a key driving force behind their advancement. Despite the significant interest in negative refraction, intrinsic non-radiative damping and ever-present fabrication imperfections of resonators in metamaterials result in significant losses at optical frequencies [16] , [17] . Similarly, negative refraction in 3D photonic crystals [18] , [19] is constrained by the refractive indices of their constituent dielectrics, is sensitive to imperfections, and operates within a narrow range of incidence angles with limited subwavelength resolution due to the requirement of wavelength-scale periodicity. Consequently, a practical application of negative refraction of light has yet to be demonstrated. Here we show that negative refraction of light can be obtained in atomic media without the use of artificially fabricated resonators. This is made possible by harnessing and utilising cooperative, non-local atom responses that arise from strong light-mediated interactions at high densities. We achieve this controlled response by considering subwavelength atomic arrays [20] with unit filling, which can be experimentally realised in system sizes up to tens of wavelengths [21] . Cooperative optical interactions in atomic arrays have recently been confirmed in transmitted light, as evidenced by the spectral resonance narrowing below the fundamental quantum limit dictated by a single atom [22] and coherently manipulated optical switching [23] . In contrast to our approach, previous proposals for utilising atomic media to achieve negative refraction have relied on quantum interference effects in multilevel systems involving inherently weak magnetic dipole transitions for independently scattering atoms [24] , [25] . These approaches necessitate, e.g., exceptionally high refractive indices at high densities, that currently surpass the limits of experimental capabilities [26] . We demonstrate the negative refraction of light through microscopic, atom-by-atom simulations that exactly incorporate all recurrent scattering processes between stationary atoms in the low light intensity limit [27] , [28] , and accurately describe experimental conditions [22] , [29] . Our analysis encompasses both the \\(J=0\\to {J}^{{\\prime} }=1\\) transition, typical of experimentally relevant alkaline-earth-metals and rare-earth metals (e.g., Sr, Yb), and a two-level transition found in cycling transitions for alkali-metal atoms, using the optical lattice spacing of Rb from light transmission experiments [22] , [23] . The simulations uncover a distinct deflection of propagating light beams in the opposite direction to what normally occurs. This enables us to extract from microscopic simulations the negative value of refractive index. We demonstrate high-transmission negative refraction that is resilient to lattice imperfections, such as missing atoms and position uncertainty, over a range of laser frequencies, incident angles, and lattice constants by modelling 3D atom arrays as stacked infinite 2D planar layers when in each layer the scattering problem is represented in momentum space. Our findings, confirmed for finite-sized arrays in a few-layer scenario through large-scale simulations, reveal that such refraction aligns with the simple phenomenology of transverse Bloch band collective resonances. Notably, negative refraction can be realised by engineering and exciting such resonance bands whose in-plane group velocities are antiparallel to the excitation quasimomenta—which are a common occurrence in moderately subwavelength arrays. Intriguingly, the effective refractive index can be significantly enhanced through coupling with more subradiant excitations.",
