    "content": "Dirac equation, proposed by Paul Dirac in 1928 as the first reconciliation of special relativity and quantum mechanics, has a profound impact on the development of many aspects of modern physics [1] . While the Dirac equation was mainly studied in the context of particle physics and quantum field theories in the early years, people later found that Dirac physics can also be accessed in crystals with band degeneracies called Dirac points [2] . In the low-energy limit, the states around a Dirac point are effectively governed by the Dirac equation and thus behave as Dirac quasiparticles [3] . Beyond Dirac, other types of quasiparticles can also emerge in certain band degeneracies [4] , [5] , such as Weyl quasiparticles [6] and even those not allowed in particle physics [7] . These quasiparticles, apart from their own theoretical interest as fundamental particles, are responsible for many topological phenomena and offer new insights for controlling the transport in crystals. For example, Dirac quasiparticles in graphene give rise to the quantum Hall effect under a magnetic field [2] , [3] , and their valley contrasting physics opens a route to manipulate electrons and forms the basis for valleytronics [8] , [9] . In recent years, nonconservative systems have appeared as a new playground for studying band degeneracies [10] , [11] . In contrast to closed systems, nonconservative systems modeled by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians typically host exceptional points where both eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce [12] , [13] , [14] . Dirac points and other Hermitian band degeneracies, on the other hand, are usually unstable under non-Hermitian perturbations [15] , [16] , [17] and can only survive under symmetry protection [18] , [19] . In the latter case, the Dirac quasiparticles still obey the conventional Hermitian Dirac equation and behave much like those in Hermitian systems [18] , [19] . To date, it is still unclear whether unique non-Hermitian physics can be obtained for conventional band degeneracies like Dirac points. In this work, we design and experimentally realize a non-Hermitian extension of the graphene lattice with a complex conjugate pair of Dirac cones. Unlike all previously realized Dirac cones in either Hermitian or non-Hermitian systems [3] , [19] , the Dirac cones in our study are intrinsically non-Hermitian. That is, the Dirac quasiparticles are governed by non-Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonians with a valley-dependent background imaginary term (see Fig. 1 and Eq. ( 2 ) below). This also differs from the trivial scenario where a uniform background loss added to a Hermitian graphene lattice induces the same imaginary term for both valleys. Given these differences, we dub the excitations around the non-Hermitian Dirac cones in our system non-Hermitian Dirac quasiparticles. We fabricate a circuit lattice to implement the theoretical model. Owing to the sharp imaginary eigenvalue contrast, one of the Dirac cones with a shorter lifetime is wiped out in the long time limit, making our system effectively exhibit single Dirac cone physics. In the experiments, we consistently find that only one of the valleys can be excited without using any tailored excitation (Fig. 2 ). This situation also holds for the massive case where the Dirac cones are gapped by a staggered on-site potential, and vortex states can be simply excited by a point source (Fig. 3 ). We then use the massive non-Hermitian Dirac cones to construct mass-flipping interfaces. It is found that the valley kink states inherit the non-Hermitian properties from the bulk and have valley-dependent lifetimes. Their propagation is effectively unidirectional and the valley flipping is significantly suppressed due to the difference in the imaginary eigenvalues between the two valleys (Figs. 4 and 5 ). These results clearly reveal that Dirac cones can be induced in non-Hermitian lattices and can have interesting non-Hermitian physics beyond their Hermitian counterparts. Fig. 1: Model for realizing non-Hermitian Dirac quasiparticles. a – c Upper panels: Tight-binding model of conventional graphene ( a ), the Haldane model ( b ), and this work ( c ). The red (blue) circles represent the sublattices with on-site energy m ( − m ) and the black lines indicate the nearest-neighbor couplings with strength t . The Orange arrows in ( b ) indicate the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings t 2 e i ϕ ( t 2 e − i ϕ ) along (opposite to) the arrow. The larger (smaller) black arrows in ( c ) denote the NNN couplings t 2 + δ ( t 2 − δ ). Lower panels: Schematics of the Dirac cone dispersion of the graphene model ( a ), the Haldane model ( b ), and the non-Hermitian model in this work ( c ). For graphene, the K and \\({{{{\\rm{K}}}}}^{{\\prime} }\\) valleys are related to each other by the time-reversal symmetry (TRS). For the Haldane model, the TRS breaking leads to a single Dirac cone in the K valley in the energy range within the bandgap of the \\({{{{\\rm{K}}}}}^{{\\prime} }\\) valley, as denoted by the orange dashed lines. In this work, a complex conjugate pair of Dirac cones at the K and \\({{{{\\rm{K}}}}}^{{\\prime} }\\) valleys are related to one another by the TRS, with colors denoting the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues. In the long time limit, only states at the K valley will survive due to the sharp contrast in lifetime between the two valleys, leading to an effective single Dirac cone behavior over a large energy range as indicated by the orange dashed lines. d Complex band structure of our proposed model for m = 0, t = 1, t 2 = 0.1, and δ = 0.1, with the colors showing the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues.
