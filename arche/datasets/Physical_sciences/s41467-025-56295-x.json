    "content": "Excessive energy consumption, particularly from the continuous burning of fossil fuels, has significantly worsened climate change [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] . Extensive research has focused on clean energy production and carbon capture to reduce the release of greenhouse gases, mainly CO 2 emissions, into the atmosphere during the process of extracting, producing, and using energy [2] , [3] , [4] . MOFs are cage-like structures containing metal nodes and organic ligands connected in infinite arrays [5] . The highly porous structures and precise pore size distributions of crystalline MOFs give them potential applications in various energy and environment-related gas separations, such as natural gas purification and CO 2 capture [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] . Crystalline MOFs typically require processing, such as pelletization, coating, or sintering, to form bulky structures for device applications, especially for membrane modules [12] , [13] . However, their practical implementation is still hampered by inherent limitations in mechanical stability of microcrystalline powders [14] , [15] . The discovery of MOF glasses, recognised as a fourth category of glass materials, given their dissimilarity to existing inorganic (non-metallic), organic and metallic families, opens up possible opportunities to process MOFs into macroscale, grain-boundary free morphologies [16] . ZIFs are a class of MOFs containing tetrahedral metal ions linked by imidazolate ions. A few types of ZIFs have been discovered with the capability to form glasses via melt-quenching [17] . These melt-quenched MOF glasses possess similar structures to amorphous silica and display viscoelastic states at temperatures above their glass transition temperatures ( T g ). Several forming methods such as hot-pressing and remelting have been explored to fabricate bulk samples of both MOF glasses and MOF crystal glass composites (CGCs) [18] , [19] , [20] . However, upon glass formation, the inherent porosity in their crystalline precursors is reduced, which would be unfavourable for possible applications in gas separation compared with other pure polycrystalline MOFs [10] , [21] , [22] , [23] , [24] , [25] . Hence, a substantial enhancement in porosity is imperative for MOF glasses to emerge as practical solutions for gas separation challenges. The introduction of pore-inducing agents can enhance the porosity of MOF glass through the decomposition of chemicals added during glass formation, such as polymers [21] , [26] . Nevertheless, achieving precise manipulation of porosity in MOF glass at the Ångstrom scale remains a significant challenge. Chemical composition of the crystalline MOFs, i.e., the type of metal nodes and organic ligands, is a decisive factor in determining their melting point and decomposition temperature [27] , [28] . Thus, to make both meltable and highly porous crystalline MOFs, it is logical to engineer a more porous topology by using similar metal nodes and organic ligands to those present in reported meltable MOFs, e.g., ZIF-4, [Zn(Im) 2 , Im=imidazolate], and ZIF-62, [Zn(Im) 1.75 (bIm) 0.25 , bIm=benzimidazolate]. The commonly employed ligand-directed strategy, which utilizes large-sized ligands to enhance porosity in crystalline MOFs, is not readily applicable to meltable MOFs. This is due to the introduction of extra ligands which may potentially lower the decomposition temperature of MOFs [21] . Large solvent molecules have previously been used as the structure-directing agents (SDAs) to synthesize crystalline MOFs with highly porous topology without introducing extra ligands. For example, Shi et al. synthesized two large pore ZIF compounds with Im organic ligands, by using dibutylformamide (DBF) and dipropylformamide (DPF) solvents as SDAs, respectively [29] . The obtained ZIFs possess the zeolite CAN and AFI topology with 12-membered rings (MR), and are termed CAN-[Zn(Im) 2 ] and AFI-[Zn(Im) 2 ], respectively. AFI-[Zn(Im) 2 ] displays pore apertures as large as 15.6 Å, which is larger than that of ZIF-4 (2.1 Å, 6 MR) and ZIF-62 (1.4 Å, 6 MR) [30] . However, CAN-[Zn(Im) 2 ] and AFI-[Zn(Im) 2 ] will recrystallize to the dense ZIF-zni phase with 4 MR before melting, similar with ZIF-4 [24] , [31] . This leads to a reduction in the porosity of the resultant melt-quenched glass, a g ZIF-zni [32] . In this work, meltable MOFs that have highly porous topologies of 12 MR have been synthesised by using both SDAs and mixed ligands of imidazole (Im) and benzimidazole (bIm) as shown in Fig. 1 . Bulky amide solvents were used as SDAs to create highly porous topologies, without introducing extra ligands. The mixed ligands of Im and bIm were used to suppress the recrystallization to dense ZIF-zni phase during the melting process and provide spatial support for porosity preservation. The obtained crystalline frameworks, termed AFI-[Zn(Im) 1.68 (bIm) 0.32 ] and CAN-[Zn(Im) 1.73 (bIm) 0.27 ], possess similar chemical compositions to the prototypical glass former ZIF-62, though they have far greater porosity. The enhanced porosity carries over to the glass upon melt quenching, resulting in high H 2 , CO 2 , and CH 4 adsorption capacities of a g AFI-[Zn(Im) 1.68 (bIm) 0.32 ], while decomposition was found during the melt quenching process of CAN-[Zn(Im) 1.73 (bIm) 0.27 ]. Moreover, a free-standing membrane was fabricated with a g AFI-[Zn(Im) 1.68 (bIm) 0.32 ], featuring record-breaking CH 4 /N 2 and CO 2 /N 2 separation performance. This porous MOF glass shows promising applications in energy gas purification and CO 2 capture.
