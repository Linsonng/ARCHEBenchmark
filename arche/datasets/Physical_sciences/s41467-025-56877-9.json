    "content": "The demand for higher-durability concrete that can withstand ion corrosion and dissolution degradation is increasing, particularly in harsh service environments such as marine settings. In these environments, enhancing the surface hydrophobicity of concrete is crucial for protecting the underlying substrate from water infiltration [1] . One effective strategy to improve the impermeability of concrete is the incorporation of silane coupling agents (SCAs) [2] , SCAs typically have a bifunctional structure consisting of organic and inorganic components [3] , which can be expressed as \\({\\left({{\\rm{RO}}}\\right)}_{3}-{{\\rm{Si}}}-{{\\rm{X}}}\\) . In acidic or alkaline solutions, the alkoxy groups \\({\\left(-{{\\rm{RO}}}\\right)}_{3}\\) , such as -CH 3 or -C 2 H 5 , undergo hydrolysis to form hydroxyl groups (-OH) [4] . These hydroxyl groups can then participate in condensation reactions with calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H), forming robust siloxane linkages on particle surfaces [5] . The organo-functional groups provided by SCAs impart hydrophobicity to concrete, effectively preventing water from penetrating its pores [6] . In practical engineering, the application of silane in concrete can be categorized into two approaches: surface treatment and initial admixture [7] . In surface treatment, the hydrolyzed silane monomers diffuse into the concrete through capillary pores, driven by a concentration gradient [8] . These monomers subsequently adsorb physically or bond chemically with C-S-H phases, gradually developing interfacial adhesion [9] . Alternatively, in the initial admixture method, pre-treated silane is directly incorporated into the fresh paste, ensuring a more uniform distribution of the silane [10] . The highly alkaline environment provided by cement hydration facilitates the endothermic hydrolysis of silane, leading to C-S-H condensation and the formation of a Si-O-Si network [11] . Therefore, blending SCAs in fresh paste is regarded as a more effective approach for designing durable cementitious materials, while also enhancing the workability of fresh paste. A study noted that incorporation of 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) into the montmorillonite partial substituted system significantly improved the fluidity of the cement paste, increasing it from 26.89% to 65.25%, and induced the formation of acicular hydration products that improved microstructure [12] . Recent reports have also confirmed that silane modification improves the flexural performance of cement paste [13] . Feng et al. found that incorporating a small amount of silanes increased both the flexural and compressive strength of ordinary mortars after 7 and 28 days of curing [14] . Despite these benefits, the inclusion of SCAs can introduce adverse effects, such as the inhibition of initial cement hydration. Rodríguez et al. [15] reported that incorporating SCAs significantly delays the emergence of hydration peak, thereby inhibiting initial hydration. This effect could be attributed to the increased repulsive force between free water and cement particles, introduced by the hydrophobic groups of the silane. Kong et al. [16] also identified this inhibitory effect on cement hydration and indicated that the influence of the hydrolysis byproducts, such as alcohols is negligible. Moreover, the hydrophobic groups of silanes negatively impact the silicate polymerization and hydrogen bond formation, thereby influencing the nucleation of the hydration product C-S-H (calcium-silicate-hydrate) and further retarding the hydration. Xie et al. [17] demonstrated that incorporating silane reduces the quantity and cumulative density of C-S-H, subsequently hindering the cement hydration process. More recent findings indicated that silane hydrolysates can form complexes with calcium ions, potentially accounting for the delayed hydration [18] . Despite these insights, there remain gaps in understanding the mechanisms of silane-induced delayed hydration. While the two aforementioned hypotheses provide plausible explanations, hydration is an inherently complex and prolonged process, where silane may exhibit different retarding mechanisms at various stages. It is worth mentioning that the mechanism of complexation and inhibition of C-S-H growth appears more relevant to the post-induction stage of hydration. However, the precise impact of silane on clinker dissolution during the induction stage warrants further exploration. Given that mineral dissolution occurs instantaneously (within seconds), direct observation poses significant challenges. As such, atomic-scale simulations offer a promising approach for studying this phenomenon. Atomistic simulations have emerged as an alternative method to provide valuable insights into the nanoscale mechanisms of the inhibition of SCAs on cement hydration [19] , [20] , [21] . Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using empirical force fields have been applied to explore lots of physical properties of cement-based materials, such as the efficiency of solution transport in calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) nanopores functionalized with silane [22] . Additionally, MD simulations based on reactive force field (ReaxFF) are extensively used to model clinker hydration processes. Li et al. [23] demonstrated that the degree of hydrolytic separation on the surfaces of M3- and T1-C3S is comparable and independent of the polycrystalline state of the crystal. Xu et al. [24] found that the complete dissolution of calcium ions in C 3 S required two dissolution processes. Otherwise, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also been performed to elucidate the adsorption behavior of water on clinker phases and SCAs on the C-S-H surface without considering the dynamics information of the reaction [25] . As theoretical methods continue to advance, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations have been increasingly adopted to accurately probe chemical reactions involving electron transfer, including key transformations in cement hydration such as adsorption and nucleation [26] . In this context, enhanced sampling techniques like metadynamics (MetaD), offer a powerful approach for exploring significant configurational changes within a system, from reactants to products [27] . Recently, it has been reported that the combination of AIMD and MetaD successfully drew a full picture of the calcium dissolution from the Ca 3 SiO 5 and Ca 2 SiO 4 surface [28] , [29] , which sheds light on the understanding of the effect of SCAs on Ca 3 SiO 5 dissolution. To elucidate the retardation effect of SCAs on cement hydration, we employed a combination of ab initio simulations and experimental corroboration to investigate the impact of APTES on the early Ca 3 SiO 5 hydration at the nanoscale. First, the accuracy of the MetaD sampling model was validated through DFT adsorption tests, followed by the exploration of the dissolution behavior of surface penta-coordinated calcium under the influence of APTES using ab initio MetaD simulations. The results indicated that the shielding effect of SCAs causes the dissolution of calcium ions to shift from a spontaneous to a non-spontaneous process. Secondly, the early hydration kinetics of silane-treated cement paste were examined through hydration experiments, which not only corroborated the interactions between Ca 3 SiO 5 particles and APTES molecules but also demonstrated that the reduced concentration of calcium ions in the hydrolytic solution is a critical factor in the retardation of cement hydration. Finally, these discoveries provide a molecular-level explanation for the delayed hydration effect of SCAs, contributing to a deeper understanding of the initial hydration of cement in organic systems.",
