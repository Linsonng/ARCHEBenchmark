    "content": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is an advanced imaging modality that is widely applied in biomedical research, drug development, and clinical diagnosis. The broad utility of PET derives from well-designed radiotracers that can report on specific protein targets and processes occurring in animals and humans in vivo [1] , [2] . Among positron-emitting radionuclides, fluorine-18 ( 18 F) is one of the most commonly used for PET [3] . This is not only because of its high accessibility in a no-carrier-added (NCA) state from modern cyclotrons through the high-yielding 18 O(p,n) 18 F reaction on [ 18 O]water [4] but also because of its many favorable physical properties for imaging and tracer design. These properties include: 1) almost pure decay ( β + , 97%) by emission of a relatively low energy positron ( β + , 0.634 MeV) enabling acquisition of images with high spatial resolution ( ca 2 mm) [5] ; 2) a usefully long half-life ( t 1/2 = 109.8 min) that i) allows time for efficient incorporation into tracers and their distribution to nearby standalone PET imaging facilities, and ii) offers the possibility to monitor tracer kinetics in vivo over a few hours [6] ; 3) a van der Waals radius similar to that of hydrogen that leads to only a minor steric perturbation when fluorine-18 replaces hydrogen at carbon; and 4) high electronegativity, enabling the alteration of molecular electrostatics and overall polarity. Indeed, since the late 1970s, fluorine-18 has featured prominently in a vast array of successful PET tracers [7] , [8] . The most frequently used methods for their preparation are based on aliphatic and aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions on substrates with good leaving groups [3] , [9] . These methods are well-established for their abilities to generate 18 F-labeled tracers in acceptable yields and with high molar activities (radioactivity per mole of all isotopologues, denoted A m ) [10] . However, the success achieved in constructing C( sp 2 )– 18 F and C( sp 3 )– 18 F bonds has not been readily translated to 18 F-labeled compounds containing multiple fluorine atoms, especially when they are situated on the same carbon atom, such as an α,α-difluoromethyl moiety (RCF 2 H). Interest in the development of methods for incorporating the α,α-difluoromethyl group (−CF 2 H) into modern pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals has surged. Examples of such bioactive molecules appear in Fig. 1A . This interest is driven by a recognition of the potential of the difluoromethyl group to confer distinct advantages in biomolecule designs [11] , [12] . For example, the highly polarized carbon-hydrogen bond in the difluoromethyl group endows this group with the capability to act as a hydrogen bond donor, an attribute that sets it apart from other polyfluorinated chemical motifs [13] , [14] . Moreover, difluoromethyl groups can serve as metabolically stable bioisosteres of hydroxy, thiol, or amino groups and can therefore be used to improve pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties [15] , [16] .

B Prior methods for accessing 18 F-labeled α,α-difluoromethylalkyl groups and their limitations. C Methodology for synthesizing 18 F-labeled α,α-difluoromethylalkyl groups at high molar activity, as presented in this work. A m molar activity, PET positron emission tomography. Full size image The demand for novel methods to access the 18 F-labeled α,α-difluoromethyl moiety and thereby to expand the chemical space for PET tracer development also continues to grow [11] . A formidable challenge in this area is to meet the need for a straightforward general method that is capable of delivering good tracer yields along with usefully high molar activities. Usually, methods give low molar activity because a pre-existing C–F bond in the precursor for radiofluorination is vulnerable to cleavage during the labeling process to produce appreciable amounts of carrier fluoride ion as a competing reagent in the reaction. In the past decade, notable progress has been made in synthesizing [ 18 F]difluoromethylated arenes and heteroarenes from [ 18 F]fluoride [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , [21] , [22] . However, these methods variously require specialized precursors, metal catalysts, or additional synthesis manipulations after radiofluorination, and they all provide mediocre molar activities for the 18 F-difluoromethylarene products. Other methods, based on generating the [ 18 F]difluoromethyl radical [23] or [ 18 F]difluorocarbene [24] , have enabled 18 F-difluoromethylarenes to be obtained with improved molar activity. Although methods to access [ 18 F]difluoromethylarenes are therefore well-established [25] , [26] , [27] , they are nonetheless unsuitable for the efficient syntheses of 18 F-labeled α,α-difluoromethylalkanes. After 2020, methods for attaching non-radioactive difluoromethyl groups to aliphatic chains were achieved with various difluoromethylating agents, such as the zinc complex, (DMPU) 2 Zn(CF 2 H) 2 , difluoroacetic acid, chlorodifluoromethane, ((difluoromethyl)sulfonyl)arenes, difluoromethyltriphenylphosphonium iodide, and N -phenyl- N -tosyldifluoroacetamide [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] , [33] , [34] , [35] , [36] , [37] . Nevertheless, these methods are not adaptable to fluorine-18 labeling due to their need for harsh reaction conditions, long reaction times, and likely outcomes of high carrier dilution. To date, few methods exist for the radiosynthesis of an 18 F-labeled α,α-difluoromethylalkane. The earliest report showed only one example with a low yield from an α-fluoroalkyl aryl thioether precursor by the combined action of the oxidant, 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, and a large excess of carrier-added pyridine·9H[ 18 F]F [38] (Fig. 1B ). More recently two methods have appeared [39] , [40] . One method requires two steps from an aryldifluorovinyl iodonium salt and gives a low molar activity [39] . Another method is single-step from a 2-fluoroalkanoic acid precursor but gives only somewhat improved molar activity [40] . This method also requires the use of an oxidizing agent and a metal-ligand mediator. Thus, there is a clear need for the development of simple and efficient broad-scope methodologies for labeling α,α-difluoromethylalkanes with fluorine-18 at high molar activity. We envisioned that [ 18 F]fluoride treatment of an α-fluoroalkane possessing a leaving group on the α - carbon might provide an 18 F-labeled α,α-difluoromethylalkane with high molar activity. Herein, we describe our development of an effective method for the direct radiofluorination of α-bromo-α-fluoroalkane precursors with [ 18 F]fluoride, enabling the efficient late-stage syntheses of 18 F-labeled α,α-difluoromethylalkanes with high molar activities. This method has several other attractive features, including amenability for automation (Fig. 1C ). We further demonstrate robust applications of this methodology for installing an 18 F-labeled α,α-difluoromethyl moiety into diverse candidate PET tracers.",
