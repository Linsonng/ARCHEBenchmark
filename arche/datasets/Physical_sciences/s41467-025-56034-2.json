    "content": "Complex networks represent the structure of several natural and artificial complex systems [1] , that exhibit ubiquitous properties such as heterogeneous connectivity [2] , efficient information transmission [3] , mesoscale [4] and hierarchical [5] , [6] organization. Moreover, additional information can be used to enrich these models considering multiplexity and interdependence [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , high-order behavior and mechanisms [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] . The richness of network modeling and analysis opens the door for a wide variety of applications across multiple disciplines, ranging from gene regulation [17] , [18] and protein interaction [19] networks in molecular biology, brain networks [20] , [21] in neuroscience, traffic networks [22] in urban planning, to social networks [23] , [24] in social sciences. Furthermore, network science has been used to study the flow of information within networks, from the electrochemical signals traveling between brain areas and pathogens spreading among social systems to the flights in airline networks and the messages being shared on social media. To this aim, often, a dynamical process is exploited that governs the short- to long-range flow between the components [25] , [26] , [27] , [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] , [33] , [34] , [35] , [36] , [37] , [38] , [39] . Yet, the largeness of many real-world systems poses a challenge, due to computational complexity and components’ redundancies in roles and features, hampering a clear understanding of how complex systems operate. Therefore, an interesting possibility is to search for proper compressions of networks– by means of grouping and coarse-graining nodes with redundant features or roles– that preserve the flow. The network renormalization method focuses on compressing the size of the network while preserving its core properties. Several pioneering methods have been proposed to coarse-grain the components. Song et al. [40] brought the concept of the Box-Covering method into the network renormalization realm [41] , with subsequent works primarily focused on enhancing its efficiency [42] , [43] , [44] . Generally, these methods treat the network as a spin system [45] and study the universality classes [46] and fractal properties [47] . As another example, geometric renormalization on unweighted graph [48] and weighted graph [49] embeds the network structure into a two-dimensional hyperbolic space, groups the nodes based on their angle similarities, and merge them into a macro network: in that space they unravel the multiscale organization of real-world networks. In the same spirit, the effective geometry induced by network dynamics have been used to uncover the scale and fractal properties [50] . As an example, spectral coarse graining [51] focuses on the dynamics on top of networks and attempts to preserve the large-scale random walk behavior of the network during structural compression. More recently, an approach based on Laplacian renormalization [52] was proposed based on diffusion dynamics on top of the network, corresponding to the renormalization of a free field theory in network structures. This method pushed the boundaries of RG to include structural heterogeneity by preserving the slow modes of diffusion. However, none of these renormalization methods is designed to preserve the macroscopic features of information dynamics simultaneously at all propagation scales for all network types. Similar to the Laplacian renormalization group, we capitalize on network density matrices [33] to describe the information dynamics in the system [53] . From density matrices, we derive the typical macroscopic indicators like network entropy and free energy, which, respectively, quantify how diverse the diffusion pathways are [53] , [54] , [55] and how fast signals travel in the system [55] , [56] . We show that such measures can be derived from the network partition function Z τ , as in equilibrium thermodynamics. On this theoretical basis, we deduce that a coarse-graining that preserves the shape of partition function across the propagation scale τ , preserves the macroscopic indicators of information flow. Therefore, we aim to reach a coarse-graining with minimum deviations from the full partition function profile. We bypass the challenge of finding an analytically closed solution for general complex networks. Avoiding simplifying assumptions and cases of poor practical interest, we leverage recent advances in machine learning based on graphs to develop the framework of the Network Flow Compression Model(NFC Model), as depicted in Fig. 1 . More technically, we use graph neural networks [57] , [58] to process and aggregate nodes’ local features like the number of connections (degree), and reach a high-level representation of them. In the representation space, it identifies groups of nodes that play redundant roles in information flow whose aggregation does not drastically change the flow and coarse-grain them to reach suitable compressions, minimizing the partition function deviation. While most coarse-graning methods define and identify supernodes by grouping nodes with similar local structures, their notion of similarity is typically predefined [48] , [49] . In contrast, our approach leverages a machine learning model to automatically learn the vital similarity features that can be used to compress the network while preserving the macroscopic flow properties. For instance, in the BA network, hub nodes are coarsened together, while leaf nodes are coarsened together. In real-world scientist collaboration networks, scientists with the highest number of collaborations are coarsened into one group, even if they don’t collaborate with(are connected to) each other. Experimental results in subsequent sections and show that our approach preserves the information flow even for large compressions, in synthetic and empirical systems. The analysis of the model’s interpretability in subsequent sections indicates that this strategy is reasonable: it preserves the function of local structures in the process of information diffusion while reducing the number of redundant structures. Fig. 1: A Schematic representation of our framework. The message-passing mechanism of the GNN collects neighbors' information to create a vector representation for each node. The Softmax method normlizes the vector leading to a node grouping. The node features we use here include degree σ d , degree’s \\({{{{\\mathcal{X}}}}}^{2}\\) --- i.e., given by \\({{{{\\mathcal{X}}}}}_{i}^{2}={(E[d]-{\\sigma }_{d})}^{2}/E[d]\\) where d is the degree of neighboring nodes---, clustering coefficient and core-number. In this case, 3 groups are considered for simplicity, represented in the group matrix S . Using both S and the original adjacency matrix A , we proceed with a compression operation expressed as: \\(\\hat{{{{\\bf{A}}}}}=\\frac{M}{N}{{{{\\bf{S}}}}}^{T}{{{\\bf{A}}}}{{{\\bf{S}}}}\\) . In this operation, \\(\\hat{{{{\\bf{A}}}}}\\) stands for the adjacency matrix of the macro network, whereas M and N symbolize the number of nodes within the macro and micro networks, respectively. The deviation of macro network’s normalized partition function from the original network is used as the loss function to supervise the GNN. Full size image Our work serves a purpose that is ultimately different from the network renormalization group methods. In fact, these methods aim to uncover the scaling behavior of systems. For instance, renormalization group methods preserve specific topological properties when compressing networks, like the degree distribution of scale-free networks. However, in other cases, for instance, in network with one or multiple characteristic topological scales, these methods are expected to capture the changes in network properties, including the flow, as it gets compressed. In contrast, our approach seeks to find a coarse-graining that preserves the flow properties, regardless of the specific features of a topology. Therefore, it is expected to outperform others in preserving the flow, when compared across distinct network families. We confirm this expectation through a series of numerical experiments demonstrated in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2: Compression for Synthetic Networks. Visual representation of the compression process applied to two representative Stochastic Block Model (SBM) networks (mixing parameters μ of 0.029 and 0.127, respectively) and Barabasi-Albert (BA) networks (numbers of links per node m of 1 and 2). The second row visualizes the structure of the macro network that was compressed to 35 nodes. The third row shows the Mean Absolute Error in the partition function before and after compression at different sizes. We selected 10 different sizes uniformly in the logarithmic space between 5 and 200. The last row shows the Mean Absolute Error of the partition function curve for different methods when compressing the network to 35 nodes. Full size image Finally, we train our graph neural networks on a vast number of real-world networks, enabling generalization to the datasets it has not seen before. We show that it leads to rapid and highly effective compressions across networks from various domains.",
