    "content": "Deep learning (DL) has become a revolutionary paradigm for solving inverse problems in science and technology [1] , [2] , [3] , including physics [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] , biology [8] , [9] , chemistry [10] , [11] , information science [12] and engineering [13] , [14] . As a typical type of DL, supervised learning excels at learning a complex relationship from large amounts of input and output data pairs for an unknown system in an end-to-end manner [15] , which has shown its capability in overcome critical challenges in computer vision [16] , [17] , natural language processing [18] , [19] , medical diagnosis [20] , [21] , [22] , and weather forecast [23] , [24] . In order to learn a mapping function of the unknown system, large-scale labeled data and extensive training are indispensable prerequisites [15] , which are time-consuming and energy-intensive. Unsupervised and self-supervised learning have been proposed to release the heavy effort of registering data pairs [25] , [26] , [27] , [28] , [29] , [30] , [31] , while sufficiently large amounts of data are still need. Therefore, there is a growing pursuit of developing untrained deep neural networks (DNNs) for acquiring the mapping function of unknown systems, where physics-enhanced DNNs have been proposed to overcome the challenge of big data by integrating physical prior into the neural network [32] , [33] , [34] , [35] , [36] , [37] , [38] , [39] , [40] , [41] , [42] , [43] , [44] , [45] , [46] , [47] . Inspired by the concept of deep image prior (DIP) [48] , untrained neural networks have been widely used in metrology [4] , holography [36] , [42] , [43] , [46] , [47] , and imaging [29] , [39] , [40] , [44] , [45] . In particular, there are several variants of the DIP for optical phase retrieval in diffraction optics [33] , [34] , [39] , [49] , where physics consistency is forced by minimizing the loss function between the estimated results and the actual measurement. Typical DIP-type DNNs for solving this inverse problem rely on a forward mapping function [33] , [34] to generate the estimated results, where an analytical model describing the physical evolution process is required [25] , [28] , [33] . The weights and biases of a physics-enhanced DNN can be updated using a loss function based on the analytical theory. It is quite efficient in dealing with the ill-posed problem of phase retrieval with solo intensity measurement [33] , [34] , [39] , [49] , [50] , [51] , where the phase retardation can be precisely described by a theory. However, generating the estimated results using an empirical model relied on the real response of system, where the model should be differentiable for the back propagation of the neural network, resembles a promising while open attempt to update the neural network in an untrained manner. Although beam propagation method [52] can account for weak scattering scenarios with negligible backward scattering [53] , [54] , the analytical models can only be applied in the scenario where strongly optical scattering is absent [33] , [34] . Furthermore, there are many optical systems without analytical theory [55] , where wave scattering systems with non-negligible backward scattering are typical examples. It renders the physics-enhanced DNNs based on the analytical theory inapplicable in these scenarios. Therefore, leveraging the DIP concept for achieving optical phase retrieval over a scattering medium remains an alluring but challenging prospect. Herein, we report a DENN for tackling scattering systems without analytical theory, where phase retrieval through an optical multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system is demonstrated by simulation and experiment, simultaneously. An experimentally calibrated empirical transmission matrix (TM) describing the forward mapping relationship of the MIMO system is integrated to the DNN for the back propagation of the neural network. This empirical model captures the relationship between multiple input and their corresponding output for the scattering system. However, unlike an analytical theory that can predict the full evolution of the system for any given input, this model resembles a partial experimental measurement of the system, providing insights for the update of DENN. It is demonstrated that the need of labeled data and training for the DENN can be eliminated by integrating the empirical model of the opaque system with a convnet. As a proof of principle, seeing through a multimode fiber (MMF) and a ground glass are achieved using a single-shot speckle intensity at their output. Considering the supervised learning using 30000 data pairs, the training and inference time are about 26 hours and 0.48 second, respectively. While the DENN achieve the same goal of optical phase retrieval using the inference time of 270 seconds, all while delivering over 58% improvement in fidelity for a given natural scene image encoded information. Our quantitative simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed DENN on solving the ill-posed inverse problem of phase retrieval using a single intensity input. Because the empirical TM can be calibrated for different scattering media, the combination of a neural network with the empirical TM is applicative for various media. Therefore, the DENN can be generalized for diverse inverse problems of information retrieval in black box systems without analytical theory.",
