    "content": "Organic solar cells (OSCs) have distinct merits such as lightness, thinness, flexibility, translucency, and colorization [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , which can meet special applications in multiple scenarios such as the Internet of Things, smart buildings, indoor photovoltaics, and wearable devices [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] , and have become one of the most promising green energy technologies. Thanks to advances in organic semiconductor photovoltaic materials and device processing techniques, particularly the swift advancement of A-DA’D-A type small-molecule acceptors (SMAs) [10] , [11] , [12] , the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 19% currently for a single junction OSC [13] , [14] , [15] . However, compared to the more efficient inorganic materials-based photovoltaic technologies, e.g. the devices based on crystalline silicon, GaAs, or perovskite, there is still considerable room for further improvement in the photovoltaic performance of OSCs due to the relatively higher energy loss ( E loss ) and lower fill factor (FF). Generally, minimizing the non-radiative voltage loss (Δ V nr ) is essential for enhancing the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) and hence the photovoltaic properties of OSCs. Further innovation and development of organic semiconductor materials have been recognized as the key to solving this issue. Gao et al. demonstrated that a low energy offset between donor and acceptor molecular states and high photoluminescence yield of the low bandgap material are the two key factors for minimizing the voltage losses ( V loss ) of OSCs [16] , [17] . Recent studies have demonstrated that introducing luminescent moieties such as fused ring groups (thiophene, benzene, etc.) to enhance the rigidity of molecular structures and/or the extent of electron delocalization could be an effective method for achieving highly luminescent donor and acceptor molecules, as well as optimal photovoltaic performance [18] , [19] . In addition, the film morphology is closely related to the charge transport properties, and thus the FF and overall efficiency of OSCs. Synergistically improving the luminescence efficiencies of materials and optimizing the morphological structure of the active layer have become the key to further improve the photovoltaic properties but with great challenges. Therefore, manipulating the intermolecular interactions between donor molecules, acceptor molecules, and/or donor–acceptor molecules to control the intermolecular coupling properties becomes a more viable strategy to realize suppressed E loss and improved FF. Inspired by their specific electronic structure and physical properties, modulating the chemical structures of A-DA’D-A type SMAs have been extensively utilized by regulating the three fundamental building blocks, including the central fused ring core unit (DA’D), electron-withdrawing end unit (A), and solubilizing side chains. Owing to the special electron delocalization characteristics, the singlet exciton (SE) excited state of Y-series acceptors could be transferred into the intra-moiety excited (i-EX) state (or namely delocalized singlet exciton (DSE)), which is beneficial for charge generation and decreased non-radiative energy loss [20] , [21] . Modifications of the side chains, such as the variation of length, topology (linear or branched), branching points, and dimension are the most frequently employed approaches for precisely modulating the solubility, molecular crystallization, and stacking behavior of SMAs [22] , [23] , [24] . For instance, Yan et al. discovered that different positions of alkyl-chain-branching can alter the molecular stacking of SMAs, optimizing phase separation and exciton dissociation [25] . It has been well established that the molecular stacking behavior can be regulated with improved structural order and charge transport in thin films by replacing the linear n-undecyl chain on Y6 with branched 2-butyloctyl, delivering significantly promoted open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) and fill factor (FF) [26] . Additionally, breaking the symmetry of the alkyl chains is also an effective way to boost photovoltaic performance [20] , [27] . For example, Yang and coworkers developed the hybrid cycloalkyl-alkyl chain-based symmetric/asymmetric acceptors Y-C10ch/A-C10ch, and the PM6:A-C10ch device based on asymmetric molecules had less energy loss [28] . Development of the acceptors with asymmetric side chains, and an in-depth understanding of the intrinsic properties of their molecules, such as molecular packing, electron coupling, and charge transport properties, especially the electron-vibrational coupling, which describes the deformations of the molecular geometries in the course of the electron-transfer process and reflects the interactions between electrons and intramolecular vibrations. Reducing the electron-vibrational coupling has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to suppress the non-radiative recombination, thus leading to suppressed non-radiative energy loss [29] . Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of the molecular performance of side-chain asymmetric acceptors in combination with detailed density functional theory (DFT) horizontal calculations and single-crystal structures is essential for a deeper understanding of the energy loss and charge transport mechanisms of their devices. To investigate deeply the effects of SMAs with symmetric or asymmetric alkyl-thienyl chains on the device performance from the perspectives of photophysical properties, morphological features, charge dynamic behaviors, etc., two SMAs with asymmetric alkyl/thienyl outer side chains (BTP-C11-TBO and BTP-BO-TBO, respectively) were synthesized in this study and compared in detail with symmetric SMAs (BTP-DC11, BTP-DBO and BTP-DTBO). In comparison to the symmetrical SMAs, the side-chain asymmetrical structure of BTP-C11-TBO and BTP-BO-TBO presented slightly broader optical bandgaps with elevated LUMO energy levels. The molecular packing results examined by GIWAXS indicate that the asymmetric alkyl/thienyl outer side chains endow the acceptors with a more planar skeleton and promote a denser network packing than the corresponding symmetric SMAs, resulting in the higher domain purity in active layers. Furthermore, the asymmetric alkyl/thienyl outer side chains can subtly modulate the D/A interfacial energetics and inhibit molecular vibration, thereby expediting exciton dissociation and mitigating energetic disorder, resulting in enhanced charge generation efficiency and reduced charge recombination. Consequently, these factors contribute to the remarkable photovoltaic performance of the OSCs based on PM6:BTP-BO-TBO and PM6:BTP-C11-TBO, with the maximum PCEs of 19.76% and 18.51%, respectively. Overall, our research not only demonstrated that the asymmetric alkyl/thienyl outer side chain strategy is a feasible approach for reducing non-radiative energy loss, improving charge generation, suppressing charge recombination, and thus boosting the efficiency of OSCs but also provided an instructive guideline for the further development of emerging organic semiconductor materials and organic optoelectronics.",
